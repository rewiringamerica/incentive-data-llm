An air source heat pump is an air conditioner with a reversing valve, so it can provide both heating and cooling for your home. Using an ENERGY STAR® ASHP in conjunction with a furnace, can save energy and money because it is approximately four times more efficient than a standard furnace during warmer winter months.\n\nIf you are considering utilizing an air source heat pump as the primary heating source in your home, a great option is a cold climate ASHP (ccASHP). It has the same benefits as a standard ASHP, but if it is sized correctly, it does not require back up heat. This is because it can run at a higher efficiency as the temps decrease to below 0°F.\n\nAs a natural gas customer, you may earn $250 on a qualifying furnace purchase, or a $500-$1,000 rebate on a qualifying heat pump purchase.\n\n1. When shopping, make sure the model you select meets the following requirements:\n\nENERGY STAR® for furnaces ($250 rebate)\nENERGY STAR® for ducted ASHP ($500 rebate)\nENERGY STAR® for ductless ASHP  ($500 rebate)\nNortheast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) for ccASHP ($1000 rebate)\n2. Purchase and install the qualifying appliance using a qualified installer. Be sure to keep receipts. \n\n"}]}

The rebate will be issued as a credit on your TEP account.\n\nWater heaters are the second highest energy user in a typical home.  An electric water heater can account for up to 25 percent of your electric bills. Heat pump water heaters are at least twice as efficient as standard electric water heaters.\n\nBy upgrading to an ENERGY STAR® heat pump water heater, you can start saving money today and for years to come.\n\nWhy heat pump water heaters are highly efficient\nHeat pump water heaters are ideal for use in warmer climates like Arizona because they use heat from the surrounding air to warm the water in the tank, and then expel the cooled air. They use electricity to move heat instead of creating heat. This makes them up to three times more efficient than standard electric water heaters.\n\nA heat pump water heater can reduce your operating costs and improve performance and reliability. They also last longer than conventional water heaters – up to 15 years.\n\nFor tips on how to choose the right-sized water heater for your home, visit Energy.gov.\n\nRebate Eligibility\nTo participate in the program, you must:\n\nBe a TEP residential customer.\nPurchase and install a new heat pump water heater with a timer/controller, either included with the unit or purchased and installed separately in this calendar year.

I want you to populate the fields in valid JSON format, with one record for each incentive.\n\nAn incentive is typically for a specific appliance or tool, like a heat pump, a battery, or a smaller tool like a snowblower. There are also free incentives like a home inspection for weatherization.\n\nData fields:\nTechnology: required field. This is a enum. It should be one of the following values (ignoring quotes if they appear): Heat Pump Heating and Cooling (HVAC), HVAC - Air Source Heat Pump, Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) / Geothermal HP, HVAC - Air to Water Heat Pump, HVAC - Ducted Heat Pump, HVAC - Ductless Heat Pump, Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWH), New Electric Vehicle, Used Electric Vehicle, Electric Vehicle Charger, Rooftop Solar, Battery Storage, Heat Pump Dryers / Clothes Dryer, Electric Stove, Weatherization (insulation and air sealing), Electric wiring, Electric panel, \"Electric lawn equipment (mower, edger, leaf blower, weedwhacker)\", Smart Thermostat, E - Bike, Induction Cooktop, Other\n\nProgram Description: required field. a brief summary of the incentive, including the amount (such as dollar value or percentage), Technology, and the most important restrictions, if any. No more than 150 characters.\n\nProgram Status: required field. This is an enum.

This field should be one or more of Point of Sale rebate, Rebate (post purchase), Account Credit, Tax Credit, or assistance program (free service). If the passage indicates the rebate is an instant rebate or applied at time of purchase, it is Point of Sale rebate. If it mentions receiving a check or mailing in an application after purchase, it is Rebate (post purchase). If it says it will apply it as a credit on the utility bill, it is Account Credit. And if it mentions tax credits, it is a Tax Credit.\n\nRebate Value: required field. A free-text version of the value of the rebate (e.g. $2, $500 per ton). If the rebate has both a percentage cap (e.g. 25% of costs) and a dollar maximum (up to $3,000), include both.\n\nNumber: required field. Only the number of the Rebate Value. If the Rebate Value is \"$2,500\", it would be 2500, and if the Rebate Value is \"$100 / ton\", it would be 100. Give percentages as a decimal; e.g. 25% is 0.25. If the incentive has both a percentage and a dollar maximum, give the percentage.\n\nAmount Type: required field. This is an enum. Possible values are: \"dollar amount\", \"percent\", or \"dollar per unit\", depending on how the Rebate Value is expressed.\n\nUnit: if the Amount type is amount per unit, then this will be the corresponding unit, such as ton, sq ft, or kilowatt\n\nAmount Minimum: minimum amount associated with the incentive, if any. Do not include commas or units like $ or % in your answer.\n\nAmount Maximum: the maximum amount mentioned by an incentive, if any. For example, if the incentive reads \"50% up to $50\", then this would be 50. Do not include commas or units like $ or % in your answer.\n\nBonus Description: description of the bonus mentioned in the incentive, if any. Bonuses are additional offers directly tied to an incentive and will likely use the words \"bonus\" or \"additional\".\n\nEquipment Standards Restrictions: specifications for the efficiency of the appliance, if any\n\nEquipment Capacity Restrictions: requirements for the size or capacity of the unit\n\nContractor Restrictions: requirements for who the unit is installed by, such as whether a licensed contractor is required\n\nIncome Restrictions: if the customer has any restrictions on their income in order to claim the rebate\n\nTax-Filing Status Restrictions: if there are any restrictions on the customer's tax-filing status (e.g. single or joint filing), list them here\n\nHomeowner/Renter: if the incentive specifically mentions being available for a particular customer type, fill it here. Valid options are Homeowner, Renter, or Both. Leave blank if it's not specifically mentioned.\n\nOther Restrictions: for other important restrictions not covered by the above\n\nStacking Details: for any restrictions on how rebates can be combined. For example, if there is a dollar limit across multiple incentives, that would go here.
