ENERGYWISE Pool Pump & Heater Rebate

VARIABLE SPEED POOL PUMP
Variable speed pumps can adjust automatically using pressure sensors, and be scheduled through built-in automation systems to align with pool usage patterns. Dakota Electric offers a rebate of $200 on any new ENERGY STAR qualified multi-speed, variable speed and variable-flow pumps with an Energy Factor (EF)  3.8. To verify that a pump is ENERGY STAR qualified, check www.energystar.gov.
HEAT PUMP POOL HEATER
A pool air-source heat pump (ASHP) heater can maintain comfortable water temperatures for either outdoor or indoor pools, and is four-to-six times more efficient than electric boiler systems. Dakota Electric offers a rebate of $400 for a new ASHP pool heating system or for the replacement of an electric resistance pool boiler system to an ASHP.
· Must be tested to AHRI 1160 testing standards.
