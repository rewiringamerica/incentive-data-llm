Store energy and get big rebates
Thermal storage systems allows for heating (or cooling) to be created during off-peak hours and then used on demand—saving you money with off-peak rates and thermal storage rebates!
How it works
Install a thermal storage system in your home or business and become eligible for both off-peak rates and associated rebates. Thermal storage system options include:
	•	Conventional underfloor heat storage.
	•	In-floor hydronic heat storage.
	•	Central thermal-storage furnaces.
	•	Thermal-storage room units.
In addition, thermal-storage cooling systems—most often used in commercial cooling systems—are eligible.
Eligibility and details
To be eligible for rebates, thermal-storage systems must take advantage of a qualified off-peak rate.
	•	$40 per kilowatt (kW) rebate (up to 500 kW) on those installed with Deferred Load, Residential Demand Control (RDC), or Fixed Time of Delivery Rates.
	•	$500 per unit (sized 9 to 25 kW) installed on our Dual Fuel Rate.
	•	$20 per kW rebate (for systems 26 kW or larger) on those installed on our Dual Fuel Rate.
Deferred Load, RDC, or Fixed Time of Delivery Rate rebates require the system to have adequate storage capacity to fully heat or cool during the maximum control period allowed by the rate serving the system. Electric cable or panel storage rebates are limited to new construction slab foundations with storage capacity (usually in a sand bank beneath the slab).
Rebate requirements
	•	Minimum installation size of 9 kilowatts.
	•	Rebates totaling more than $10,000 require prior approval.
	•	In combined thermal-storage/air-source heat pump systems, this rebate applies only to the thermal-storage load—heat pump systems are rebated separately.
Apply for your rebate
