What to Look for When Considering a GSHP
Ground Source Heat Pumps, commonly referred to as geothermal, are complex systems and consumers should look for certain credentials before hiring a GSHP contractor
	1	Check the status of or verify the contractor's state mechanical bond. Both Minnesota and Wisconsin require, by law, that all mechanical contractors carry a current and valid state bond certificate. This protects you by providing a path for action if your contractor does not hold up their end of the deal. You can do a search for Minnesota at: https://secure.doli.state.mn.us/lookup/licensing.aspx and Wisconsin at: https://app.wi.gov//licensesearch.
	2	Verify IGSHPA accreditation. The International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA) is the highly recognized research training arm of the geothermal industry. Continuing education credits (CEUs) must be fulfilled to renew accreditation and membership every 3 years. For more information on IGSHPA accreditation, click here. This list of IGSHPA accredited contractors will be reviewed annually.
	3	Look for contractors that are members of the Minnesota Geothermal Heat Pump Association (MNGHPA). Members of this association must also be members of IGSHPA.
	4	Search consumer advocacy organization websites such as the Better Business Bureau.
	5	Ask for referrals — Ask friends, neighbors, and co-workers for contractor referrals. You can also contact local trade organizations for names of members in your area.
	6	Call references — Ask contractors for customer references and call them. Ask about the contractor's installation or service performance, and if the job was completed on time and within budget.
Please allow 8–10 weeks for receipt of rebate check. Some restrictions may apply.
For questions about the status of your rebate, call 1-855-669-8196.
