Stay comfortable and save with a heat pump
Heat pumps don't make heat—they move it and are efficient and environmentally friendly.
Heat pumps keep you warm in the winter, and cool in the summer, and can be installed in any home or business. You’ll not only lower your energy bills, but we'll give you money back through a rebate on qualified equipment.
You can save with three different types of heat pumps:
	•	Cold-climate air-source heat pumps (CCHP): Inverter compressor technology provides nearly 200% efficiency at 0°F., and up to 400% efficiency at temperatures of 40ºF. They'll meet up to 90% of your heating needs and after rebates will cost about the same as a standard central air conditioner.
	•	Air-to-water heat pumps (AWHP): A great option when pairing with a hydronic in-floor heating system. AWHPs achieve efficiencies over 150%.
	•	Geothermal heat pumps: deliver the highest overall efficiency—reaching to more than 400% efficiency, to reduce annual heating and cooling by up to 70%
