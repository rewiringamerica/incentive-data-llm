Benefits of Heat Pump Water Heaters
	•	Because these water heaters aren’t creating heat, but moving it, they can be two to three times more energy efficient than conventional electric resistance water heaters
	•	Although more expensive to purchase than a conventional electric water heater, they provide significant savings over time. The savings will pay back the difference in upfront costs typically in 2-5 years
	•	Heat pump water heaters can reduce your electric water heating costs by more than 50%
	•	Quiet operation

How Does It Work
Heat pump water heaters use electricity to remove heat from the surrounding air and transfer it to the water in the tank. The concept of moving heat rather than creating it can be realized in other recognizable technologies like refrigerators and geothermal systems (Ground Source Heat Pumps).
￼
As HPWHs remove heat from the air, they also provide dehumidification to the surrounding area. These systems would be ideal for moist areas that could benefit from moisture being removed from the air. Additional ideal locations would be laundry rooms or mechanical rooms that tend to produce unneeded heat.
