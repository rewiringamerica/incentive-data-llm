Save with discounted off-peak prices and water heater rebates
Heating your water has never been so affordable! Get generous rebates when you install an electric water heater and enroll in our off-peak programs.
Eligibility and details
	•	Eligible water heaters require proof of a minimum of 90% efficiency—uniform energy factor (UEF) rating of .90 or higher.
	•	Rebates require enrollment in one of our off-peak programs. Eligible programs include Deferred Load, Dual Fuel, Residential Demand Control, or Controlled Water Heating, including the water heating credit option, which eliminates the need for a second meter and saves on wiring costs.
	•	For new off-peak installations, “new” refers to water heating loads specifically. If you have an existing off-peak rate in place for space heating, you can qualify for a rebate by adding a water heater to that rate.
	•	Both residential and commercial rebates are available.
Rebates available
Residential and light-duty commercial rebates
	•	$300 rebate: Qualifying 80-gallon or larger water heater, installed on a new off-peak service.
	•	$150 rebate: Qualifying 80-gallon or larger water heater, installed as a replacement on an existing off-peak service.
	•	$150 rebate: Qualifying 50-79-gallon water heater, installed on a new off-peak service.
	•	$75 rebate: Qualifying 50-79-gallon water heater, installed as a replacement on an existing off-peak service.
