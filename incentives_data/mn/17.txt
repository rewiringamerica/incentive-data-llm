Smart Thermostats
Smart thermostats are a great way to save energy on your heating and cooling costs. Before purchasing a new thermostat, make sure you know what type of thermostat will be compatible with your current setup.
Low voltage thermostats are the most common type of thermostats. These systems are best with controlling a central heating system. Generally, if your house has ducts and has one central thermostat for both air conditioning and heating, it is most likely you’d have a low voltage thermostat. These typically run at 24V and control the heating system’s blowers, fans, and pumps (but do not power them).
