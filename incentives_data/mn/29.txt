Electric vehicle charging station program requirements and guidelines
What you’ll need to participate
	•	A Level 2 charging station. This requires a dedicated 240V circuit and Level 2 EV supply equipment. You may expect to pay around $1,000 for wiring the required equipment. Your costs will vary depending on the structure of your home and service location.
	•	A disconnect and relay. The disconnect and relay must tie into the supplied energy load. The required relay will receive its input from the relay we provide that operates based on the rate's energy delivery schedule, which limits energy supply to the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
	•	Proof of vehicle registration. Your EV must be registered in the State of Minnesota.
