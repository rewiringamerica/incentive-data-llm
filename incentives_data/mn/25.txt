Home Energy Analysis
A Home Energy Analysis (HEA) can help you determine how you use energy and what you can do to get the most for your energy dollar. Our friendly and professional auditors will help you identify ways to save energy in your home and you’ll receive energy-saving products (at no charge). You can also customize your HEA according to your unique energy-saving goals (see below).
How to request the HEA that's right for you:
FREE HEA with Electric Energy Emphasis
It's easy—Fill out the online request form and a qualified energy auditor will contact you to set up a visit.
OR
Advanced HEA with Building Diagnostics (fee-for-service)
Contact a participating building diagnostics auditor to set up your Advanced HEA (includes blower door testing and infrared thermal scanning). Minnesota Power offers an HEA with Building Diagnostics Rebate. Because cost of the service varies, it is advisable to contact multiple participating auditors for a price quote.

FREE HEA with Electric Energy Emphasis
Your energy auditor will help you find out how to get the most for your energy dollar. One of our friendly energy auditors will visit your home and analyze how you use energy, determine your electric energy use per appliance and develop an action plan for saving energy and managing costs.
You'll learn how to optimize your electric usage by changing the way you use appliances through day-to-day choices, how to determine the "right fit" for investments in energy-saving equipment, heating and cooling, appliances and lighting, and how to take advantage of Minnesota Power's rebates.
Program Offerings
	•	Free energy-efficient products and resources to help you save energy in your home.
	•	A detailed action plan to stop wasting energy in your daily activities at home.
Participation Requirements
	•	Participant must be a Minnesota Power customer (e.g., responsible for his or her own Minnesota Power electric bill).
	•	No more than one Home Energy Analysis every two years per dwelling.
	•	Must reside in a four-unit property or less. 5+ unit dwellings are not eligible.
	•	Participant must be at home during the analysis. Allow up to 2 hours for completion of the in-home analysis.
In some cases, Minnesota Power will work with your gas utility or Community Action Agency (CAA)* to deliver a comprehensive energy analysis. Check with your heating fuel provider or CAA to see if they participate.

Advanced HEA with Building Diagnostic Services (fee-for-service)
Does your home have two or more of the following?
	•	Cold drafts in winter
	•	Sweaty windows in winter
	•	Uneven temperatures between rooms
	•	Heating system does not keep home comfortable
	•	Cooling system does not keep home comfortable
	•	Ice dams
If so, you might want to consider the Advanced HEA with Building Diagnostics. This program takes a traditional Home Energy Analysis to the next level by adding blower door testing and infrared thermal scans to identify air leaks and reduced insulation levels in your home.
Minnesota Power offers a rebate on an Advanced HEA with Building Diagnostics—$100 rebate for non-electrically heated homes or a $200 rebate for electrically heated homes. You must work with a participating building diagnostics auditor to qualify for this rebate. Because the cost of service varies by degree of analysis, level of expertise, the age of the home and travel distance, it is advisable to contact multiple participating auditors for a price quote.

	•	Free energy-efficient products and resources to help you save energy in your home.
	•	A detailed action plan to stop wasting energy in your daily activities at home.
	•	Information on air leaks and low insulation levels through blower door analysis and thermal infrared scans.
	•	A prioritized implementation plan for addressing air leaks and insulation levels, along with information on air quality and addressing moisture issues.
	•	Rebates and other special offers may be available through your gas company and in Duluth through the Duluth Energy Efficiency Project (DEEP).
Participation Requirements
	•	Must be an owner-occupied, single family dwelling. Participant must be a Minnesota Power customer responsible for his or her electric bill.
	•	Participant must be at home during the HEA with Building Diagnostics. Please allow up to four hours for completion of this detailed on-site analysis.
