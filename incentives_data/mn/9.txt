Weatherization Assistance Program
Info for Service Providers
	•	Policies and guidelines for providers
The Weatherization Assistance Program provides free home energy upgrades to income-eligible homeowners and renters to help save energy and make sure your home is a healthy and safe place to live.
Weatherization works closely with its companion program, the Energy Assistance Program, to help permanently reduce the energy bills for low-income Minnesotans.

If your household qualifies, an energy auditor may evaluate your home to determine if weatherization is needed. The auditor will look for opportunities to make your home more energy efficient by sealing air leaks, adding insulation and checking if the furnace is working properly.
Stakeholder Engagement
2021-22 Weatherization Working Group
The Minnesota Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) is a predominantly federally funded, statewide, residential assistance program for income-eligible households run by Minnesota’s Department of Commerce. WAP services are comprehensive in nature, utilizing a whole-house approach in order to achieve, on average, 20-30% in permanent energy reduction through the implementation of energy efficiency measures. It is estimated that it would take over 290 years to serve all income-eligible households in Minnesota. So in 2021 an informal Weatherization Working Group made up of a cross-sector group of individuals from legislators to low-income advocates, utilities, service providers, and other partners was formed to assess current barriers to service and establish both recommendations for the Minnesota Legislature and for State WAP leaders. At the following links you will find the PDFs of the complete reports.

2023 Income Guidelines for Weatherization Assistance Program
If your household income meets the guidelines listed below, you may qualify for weatherization services.
	•	Based on 200% of Federal Poverty Income Guidelines (effective February 3, 2023) or is eligible for assistance under the LIHEAP income limit of 50% of State Median Income (effective October 1, 2023), whichever is greater.  Income limits are generally updated annually. 
	•	For each additional household member add $10,280 to annual income and $857 to the one-month income. 
The Weatherization Assistance Program uses the previous calendar month of household income to determine eligibility. Households that have received Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) within the last 12 months are eligible. Priority is given to households with elderly or disabled members, households with children under age 19, and households determined to be high energy consumers.
