Schedule an energy assessment and start saving
Increase your home’s heating and cooling efficiency—and save money while you’re at it—with our Home Transformer program.
￼
Thermal imaging reveals locations where your home is losing energy.
With Home Transformer, an energy expert will measure your home’s efficiency and evaluate your energy use, providing you with a report of efficiency recommendations.
And the assessment and report are both free!
How it works
We offer a limited number of Home Transformer assessments per year and schedule groups by geographic area. We encourage customers to apply so we can better plan a trip to your area.
Your free energy assessment includes:
	•	Blower door test: determines your home’s airtightness.
	•	Thermal-imaging analysis: gauges the effectiveness of insulation.
	•	Detailed report: recommends ways to improve your home’s efficiency, and provides estimates of energy cost savings.
￼
In addition, you’ll receive a home efficiency kit, which includes:
	•	Eight (8) LED lightbulbs
	•	Outlet gaskets
	•	Window caulking
	•	Weather stripping
	•	One (1) low-flow showerhead
	•	Two (2) faucet aerators
	•	Pipe insulation
	•	One (1) advanced power strip
	•	One (1) door sweep

	•	Use electricity as your primary source of heat and water heating.
	•	Be present, or have someone 18 or older present, during the assessment.
