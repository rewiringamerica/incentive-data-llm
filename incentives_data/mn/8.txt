Dakota Electric Association® has rebates for qualifying battery -powered yard tools. Today's battery-powered yard tools can handle most yard work, are reliable and easy to operate and maintain. Use this guide to help determine the right tool for your needs.

COST
Consider your personal lawn, snow blowing and landscaping needs. Do you have a large or small yard? Will you be blowing light or heavy debris? How large is your area for clearing snow?
Before choosing a low-cost basic model, talk to an expert at your local hardware store or research tools online. In the end, a low-cost, basic tool might cost more than a more expensive option.
VOLTAGE & AMPERAGE
Consider voltage (the pressure) and amperage (the volume) a power tool can provide. Amp-hours is sometimes listed to indicate run time at a given voltage.

BATTERY
Use a common battery platform so one battery can be used with multiple tools of the same brand. Also, consider charge time when planning to use the same battery with multiple tools.
