ENERGYWISE Air-Source Heat Pumps

DUCTLESS / MINI-SPLIT
A ductless, or mini-split, airsource heat pump does not require ductwork in your home. There is one outdoor condenser connected to one or more indoor air distribution units. Indoor units are typically mounted on the wall, floor or ceiling. The individuallycontrolled indoor units allow for zoned heating and cooling, which maximize comfort and energy savings.
A good fit when:
· Already heating with radiators, in-floor, or electric baseboard heat.
· Getting rid of window air conditioners or adding home cooling.
CENTRAL / DUCTED
A central air-source heat pump uses existing ductwork to distribute heated and cooled air throughout your home. The outdoor condenser is connected to the indoor furnace fan. Unlike a central air conditioner, a central air-source heat pump provides both heating and cooling in a single system. A registered HVAC contractor must apply and submit this rebate information to Dakota Electric.
A good fit when:
· Already heating with forced air (with ductwork in place).
· Replacing a central air conditioner or adding one for the first time.

An air-source heat pump (ASHP) uses electricity to heat and cool. It works like an air conditioner to cool, and works in reverse to move warmth from outside air into your home to heat. It heats a home up to three times more efficiently than forced-air and electric-resistance heating systems.

HEATING WITH AN ASHP
If you want an ASHP to be your primary heating system, you'll need a cold climate ASHP (ccASHP) and a back-up heating system. While ccASHPs are more expensive upfront than ASHPs, there is a potential for heating-fuel cost savings if you already heat with electricity or propane. An ASHP's heating performance is noted with its HSPF (heating season performance factor).

COOLING WITH AN ASHP
ASHPs and ccASHPs offer the same cooling benefit as an air conditioner (A/C). An ASHP's cooling performance is noted with its SEER (seasonal energy efficiency ratio), same as you would see for A/C units. Look for SEER 15 or higher for improved energy efficiency.

NEXT STEPS
1. Determine whether a ductless or central ASHP will work best with your existing heating system.
2. A rebate of $500-$800 is available for an 8.2 to 9+ HSPF air-source heat pump installed by a registered* HVAC contractor.
3. Ask contractors the right questions:
· Does the company have a state license for HVAC?
· Are they insured?
· How long have they been in business?
· Can they send a NATE-certified or other technician with education credits or experience on ASHPs to my home?
· Tell the contractor your needs (cooling, heating, both). If heating through the winter, ask for a "cold climate ASHP."
