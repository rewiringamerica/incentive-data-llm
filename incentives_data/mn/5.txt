Heat pump technology is one of the most advanced and energy-efficient heating and cooling technologies available. Heat pumps do not create heat, like combustion furnaces do. They simply transfer or "pump" heat using heat exchangers, compressors and refrigerant.

GROUND-SOURCE HEAT PUMP
Ground-source heat pumps, also called geothermal heat pumps, take advantage of the consistent temperature underground. In the winter, heat is pumped out of the ground and transferred to the air in your home. In summer, the process is reversed and heat is pumped from the building into the ground.
As added benefits, a ground-source heat pump has the potential to provide free hot water all summer, offers the option of hydronic floor heating without the need for a boiler, and is maintenance free since the underground pipes are designed to last 50 years.
