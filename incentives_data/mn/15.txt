What is a Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pump (ccASHP)?
A new generation of ASHPs has been hitting the market in recent years that benefit those in colder climates such as the Midwest. The technology has improved drastically over the years, allowing these systems to provide heat at higher efficiencies in subzero temperatures. This advancement in technology is making the use of these ccASHP’s even more attractive to people living in areas where winters are especially cold. The heating capabilities of these systems allow for heating not only in the shoulder months, but well into the winter months too. Not only are heat pumps great alternatives to the classic cooling (and dehumidification) systems, but with the technological advancements of the ccASHPs, they are a great alternative to conventional heating methods as well.
