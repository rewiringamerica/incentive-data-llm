Smart Thermostats
Smart thermostats are a great way to save energy on your heating and cooling costs. Before purchasing a new thermostat, make sure you know what type of thermostat will be compatible with your current setup.
Line voltage thermostats are wired directly to your heat source at high voltages (120V or 240V). If you have electric baseboards, you most likely use line voltage compatible thermostats to control them. A great advantage to line voltage options is the ability to create zoned heating; this allows you to control the heat in each individual room separately, thus creating zones.
Comfortable. Convenient. Smart.
