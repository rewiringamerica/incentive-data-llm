EV Charger Rebates
Claim a rebate from TEP of up to $500 on EV chargers.


TEP residential customers who purchase a Level 2 electric vehicle charger can claim a rebate of up to $500, depending on the output amperage of the charger:

$200 for less than 30 amps
$300 for 30 to 49 amps
$500 for 50 or more amps
The rebate will be issued as a credit on the customer's TEP account. A maximum of two incentives are allowed per premise for each charger purchased for home use with a highway-approved battery electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle.

To qualify for the TEP rebate, residents must:
Purchase a new Level 2 or higher EVC in this calendar year. Tesla Mobile Connector, Rivian Portable Charger, WebGo Dual Volt, and other mobile, portable, and dual volt chargers are not eligible. Rebates are not offered on used, resold or refurbished chargers.
Provide a valid proof of purchase, including the charger's model number, from a local retailer, the TEP Marketplace* or an online retailer (not to include eBay or other resale sites) that ships the item to the customer’s service address in TEP’s territory.
Be on an active Time-of-Use (TOU) rate plan and remain on the plan for a minimum of two years.
The charger must be installed at the customer’s TEP service address.
