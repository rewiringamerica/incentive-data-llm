Electric Vehicle Charging Rebate
Approved by the ACC, Mohave Electric is proud to announce our new program, Mohave Charged, which offers rebates for both the installation of electric vehicle charging stations and storage batteries.

With the increasing support for renewable energy resources, Mohave Electric now offers both commercial and residential rebates for installing electric vehicle charging stations. Charging stations must be Level 2 or higher, have programable controls and/or have wi-fi capabilities, and must not be used during On-Peak periods.

At MEC, we understand the increasing number of Electric Vehicles (EV) will drive the need for residential EV charging stations at a member’s home. A rebate of $1,000 will be available for each qualifying charging station.

The Commercial EV Charging Station Program assists members within MEC’s service territory by reimbursing funds used to install Level 2, or greater, Electric Vehicle charging stations available for MEC members and the public. A rebate of $2,750 will be available for each qualifying charging station.

Rebate application must be accompanied by installation receipts and signed off building permits.

RESIDENTIAL & COMMERCIAL REBATE APPLICATION
Battery Rebate
Mohave Electric is also now offering a commercial and residential battery rebate for our members for battery stations that are purchased and installed after January 9, 2022.

This new Residential / Commercial Battery Storage Program supports member’s renewable energy, maximizes savings on member’s electric bills, and reduces MEC’s peak demand. A rebate of $500 for each qualifying battery installation program will incentivize Mohave Electric members to install 5 kWh, minimum usable capacity battery unit. Battery units must have programable controls and/or have wi-fi capabilities and must not be charged during On-Peak periods.

Rebate application must be accompanied by installation receipts and approved building permits.
