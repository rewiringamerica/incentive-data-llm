If you're a customer considering a rooftop solar system and plan to enroll in one of SRP's demand-based price plans, it's important to minimize your on-peak energy demand to help lower your electric bill. SRP's Customer Generation and Average Demand price plans both include a demand component to the monthly bill.

To make managing demand easier, SRP is offering a $250 rebate for the following demand management systems when purchased from and installed by an SRP preferred solar installer at the time of your solar installation:

Inergy Systems - Smart Panel 3000© (SP3000)
Inergy Systems - Smart Energy Management System© (SEMS)
Brayden Automation Energy Sentry™ 9388A DMS
How it works
A demand management system is an innovative technology that lets you automate when major appliances run during on-peak hours to make sure they don't run at the same time. With a demand management system, you can:

Monitor and control your home's electric load.
Reduce peak demand costs and help reduce your electric bill.
Optimize when your home uses energy.
Add convenience with set-and-forget operation.
Who is eligible for the $250 rebate
SRP residential electric customers installing a new rooftop solar system with an SRP preferred solar installer are eligible to participate. The demand management system must be listed on the Distributed Energy Resource application, the electrical drawings and the price quote. This rebate is limited to only one per household.
