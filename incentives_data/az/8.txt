How BYOT works (and how you save)
As a BYOT participant, your thermostat will automatically adjust a few degrees higher during periods of high power demand. These periods usually last no longer than three hours — they’re called “conservation events.” In order to maximize the comfort in your home during a conservation event, your thermostat may or may not be adjusted prior to the event to precool your home.

During a conservation event, adjusting your thermostat just a few degrees can be a big help to our grid, easing demand for power during the hottest, busiest times of the day. This lowers our operating costs – and helps ensure a reliable supply of power – and we pass the savings on to you.

Already have a smart thermostat? Enroll in BYOT to get paid.
Our BYOT program is designed to reward you for using less electricity during hours of high demand. This is better for the environment and helps ease strain on the power grid.

After you enroll, you'll receive a $50 SRP bill credit per thermostat (up to $100 if you have more than one eligible thermostat). You'll also earn a $25 bill credit (per eligible thermostat) each year you remain enrolled in the program.

To be eligible to enroll, you must:

Be an SRP residential electric customer
Use your thermostat to control your central air conditioning
Have installed an eligible internet-connected thermostat
