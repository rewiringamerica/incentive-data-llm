HEATING AND COOLING REBATES
LELWD is pleased to offer rebates to customers purchasing qualified heating or cooling products. This rebate is for replacements or upgrades and not for new construction. These products are significantly more energy-efficient than the average comparable model.
Terms and Conditions and Printable Application
Eligibility: This program offers rebates for residential customers who have a licensed contractor install a qualified heating or cooling product, as defined by the Qualifying Products section of this document. Eligible installations are for replacements or upgrades to your existing systems and is not for new construction. Purchases must be made within one year of applying for a rebate.
Customers in Littleton Electric Light Department (LELD) service area are eligible for rebates subject to the availability of funds from LELD. LELD reserves the right to change any portion of this program or end this program at any time without notice.
Qualifying Products: LELD offers rebates for residential customers who install ducted, Central Air and/or Air Source Heat Pumps that meet energy efficiency standards as specified:

What is a Central Air Conditioning (AC) System?: As opposed to ductless, window-based units, Central AC units operate from a central location, moving the cool air throughout the house through a series of supply and return ducts. They are often conveniently controlled through the household thermostat, but must be installed correctly (with proper duct sealing, airflow measurements and proper sizing for the space) in order to operate efficiently.
What is an Air Source Heat Pump?: Heat pumps can provide cost-effective and energy-efficient heating and cooling for homes. While traditional systems burn fuel to create heat, a heat pump instead works by moving heat into or out of a home. Though they require electricity to operate, efficient heat pumps can provide the same amount of heating for a third of the electricity needed for traditional electric heating.
Heat pumps circulate a liquid, called a refrigerant, between an indoor air-handling unit and an outdoor radiator. When heating a home, the heat pump heats the liquid by pressurizing it, pumps it from outdoors inside, and then circulates it through the home’s heating system.
After the liquid transfers the heat into the building, it is depressurized and cooled. The liquid then travels to the outdoor radiator, where the ambient temperature warms the refrigerant, and the process begins again.
Heat pumps can also be used to cool homes through a similar process. In this case, the warm air inside a home or building is cooled by the liquid, which has been depressurized. The refrigerant is then sent outside and pressurized, which heats it up, and the ambient outdoor temperature cools it.
Air-source heat pumps use the temperatures of the outdoor air to heat or cool homes. Advancements in technology over the past few years have made air-source heat pumps an efficient source of heating and cooling in cold climates like Massachusetts. Models on the market today can operate efficiently even when it is below zero Fahrenheit.
Much like air conditioners, air-source heat pumps can be installed either as central units or split units. Central units utilize a building’s heat distribution system to heat and cool a home. Split units typically provide heating and cooling to just one area of a home, reducing demand on the existing heating system.
What is a Mini-Split Heat Pump?: A mini-split system is composed of two components: an outdoor condensing unit and one or more indoor air handling units, connected by a conduit through your wall. They usually have no ducts, but can sometimes have a short duct system. Mini-split heat pumps can produce cooling for the summer months and heating in the winter months.
Rebate amounts and payments: Rebates will be for $250-$500 per installation. Rebate applications will be processed as they are received and rebates will be issued in the form of a bill credit.
Verification: A copy of original sales receipt indicating make, model, purchase date, purchase location, and price must accompany rebate application. Energy efficiency documentation must also accompany the rebate application in order to ensure that the product purchased meets LELD standards. Incomplete applications will be returned.
