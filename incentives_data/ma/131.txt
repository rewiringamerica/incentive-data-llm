Connected Homes
Connected Homes is a program offered to customers of Shrewsbury Electric and Cable Operations (SELCO) that leverages the technology of smart appliances and devices into cost savings for the light department and its customers. The program allows SELCO to better manage its electric load, reduce costs, and keep rates low.
Enrollment Details
By enrolling a smart device in the Connected Homes Program, customers agree to allow Connected Homes to make brief, limited adjustments to their devices during times of peak electric demand, such as temporarily turning off an electric vehicle charger during peak hours.
Customers will be informed of possible adjustments in advance via email and will be given the choice to opt out.
Customers who decide to participate in adjustments will be given an incentive check.
