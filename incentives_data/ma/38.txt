Why consider ENERGY STAR Appliances? For the average Massachusetts household, the biggest consumers of energy after space heating are their appliances, electronics, and lighting. Choosing ENERGY STAR certified products to replace your aging household appliances not only reduces your environmental impact, it also saves you money over the life of the product. 
According to ENERGY STAR's website, households that choose ENERGY STAR products can typically expect to save $595 annually on their energy bills.
