Solar Rebate
Hingham Municipal Lighting Plant will offer a rebate to customers who install and own a photovoltaic system at their homes. For more information about the solar rebate or additional resources, please contact us. 



System Installation
HMLP will offer a rebate in the form of a check (effective January 1, 2021) to customers who install and own a photovoltaic system at their homes in Hingham. The amount of the rebate will vary according to the capacity of the photovoltaic system (AC). There is a cap of $6,000 per account. HMLP will rebate $0.60/W x the rated output of the system (AC) up to $6,000.
For example, an HMLP customer who installs a photovoltaic system at their home in Hingham and whose system has a rated output of 2.5kW (AC) will receive a rebate check for $1,500. If that same customer installed a system with a rated output of 10kW (AC), they would receive a rebate check for $6,000. If they installed a system with a rated output of 5kW (AC) they will receive a rebate check for $3,000.
