Hudson Light & Power Department Off-peak Charging Program Application
Program Summary Sign up for this valuable EV rewards program open to Hudson and Stow residents. Simply set your car to charge between 10 pm and 9 am on weekdays and complete the enrollment process. You then earn an $10 a month credit on your HLPD electric bill for Level 2 charging or an $5 a month credit on your HLPD electric bill for Level 1 charging. HLPD having some of the lowest electric rates in MA, this could be like paying just one dollar per gallon equivalent of electric driving mileage!
Required Documents & Application Directions (1) Fill out all fields in form. Your application will be returned if any fields are empty. (2) Provide a copy of your vehicle's registration. Address on registration must match the HLPD service address associated with the HLPD account number. (Name of vehicle registration doesn't need to match HLPD accountholder's name.) (3) Enter charger information. (4) Signatures on page 2: Accountholder must sign the Signature section on page 2. (5) HLPD reserves the right to monitor compliance of vehicle charging times. If a customer charges their EV during the weekday on-peak time period, the customer will not receive the monthly off-peak charging incentive on their next billing cycle. Incentive eligibility will resume for the following month. (6) Pictures of vehicle's screen show the vehicle is programmed to charge off-peak.

Program Eligibility (1) Your HLPD residential electric account must be at least 6 months old and have zero balance (no arrears). (2) HLPD will conduct an engineering review. (3) You must own or lease the EV. An EV is defined as either a fully electric battery vehicle (BEV) that runs exclusively on electricity, or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) that runs on electricity but can switch to gas/electric hybrid mode. (4) You may use a Level 1 or Level 2 charger. (HLPD offers a $500 rebate on new installed Smart (Wi-Fi Capable) Level 2 chargers.)
