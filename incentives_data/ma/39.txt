Why consider Electric Lawn Equipment?
Small engines like those in lawn mowers, snow blowers and similar yard equipment are significant contributors to air pollution. These engines emit high levels of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and other pollutants that can impair lung function and inhibit plant growth. Electric lawn equipment is quiet, requires less maintenance and does not emit green house gas like their fossil fuel burning counterparts.
