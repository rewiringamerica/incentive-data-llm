Why consider a Smart Thermostat?
For the average household, as much as half of your energy bill comes from the energy you use to heat and cool your home.  A smart thermostat can help you save up to 10% per year on heating and cooling costs according to the Department of Energy's Energy Saver Guide.  Smart thermostats also provide more convenience and control when it comes to keeping your home comfortable throughout the year.
