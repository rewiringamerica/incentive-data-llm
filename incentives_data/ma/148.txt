Benefits of Residential Batteries
Residential batteries can be paired with solar panels to store excess energy generated by the panels during the day for later use after sunset. Residential batteries can also provide back up for critical loads in the home, like refrigerators and Wi-Fi, in case of a power outage. Residents should consult with their installer to get the most out of their battery installation.
Residential Battery Rebates
Sterling Municipal Light Department (SMLD) offers rebates on residential lithium-ion battery systems.  To qualify, batteries must be Duracell, Emporia, Sonnen, or Generac PWRCell brands and have a storage capacity of 7.5 to 20 kilowatt-hours (kWh).  Eligibility for the rebate requires enrollment in the Connected Homes program where additional incentives of $30/month for participation in peak events are available.
The rebates and incentives for the program are intended to make the purchase of battery systems easier for residents in exchange for sharing the battery capacity to help keep electric costs lower for all SMLD customers.
