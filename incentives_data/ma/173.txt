Energy Efficiency Programs
WMGLD is offering rebates to its customers in several categories of energy saving improvements and purchases including appliances, home improvements, electric vehicles, and cordless battery-operated yard equipment. The menu to the left provides access to all the information regarding programs available to WMGLD customers. For a breakdown of all of our rebates, please refer to our Rebate Summary document.
NOTE: Many of the available rebate programs require a home energy audit to be performed prior to the installation of a purchased appliance or home improvement. Also note that there is a total rebate cap of $2500 per calendar year, per household.
Please refer to the sidebar on the left for information on residential programs, and commercial programs.
Rebates will show up as credits on your WMGLD bill. Please allow 4 – 6 weeks for the credit to appear.
