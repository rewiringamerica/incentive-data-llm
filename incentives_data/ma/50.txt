Heat Pump Water Heater
LELWD is pleased to offer rebates to customers purchasing selected ENERGY STAR-rated heat pump water heaters. This rebate is for replacements or upgrades and not for new construction. These products are significantly more energy-efficient than the average comparable model.
Terms and Conditions and Printable Application
Eligibility:  This program offers rebates for residential customers who have a licensed plumber install a qualified heat pump water heater to replace or upgrade their existing water heater. New construction is ineligible for this rebate. Customers in Littleton Electric Light Department (LELD) service area are eligible for rebates subject to the availability of funds from LELD.  LELD reserves the right to change any portion of this program or end this program at any time without notice.
Qualifying Purchases:  Heat pump water heaters must be ENERGY STAR, have an energy factor of 2.3 or greater, come with a 10 year product warranty, and purchase must be made within one year of applying for a rebate.
Rebate amounts and payments: Rebates will be $250 (<55 gallons) or $100 (>55 gallons). Rebates will be processed as they are received and rebates will be issued in the form of a bill credit.
Verification:  A copy of original sales receipt indicating make, model, purchase date, purchase location, and price must accompany rebate application.  Incomplete applications will be returned.
Additional Information: Call LELWD at (978) 540-2222 or email [email protected]
