REceive a monthly incentive for enrolling a Qualifying smart device in the connected homes program
Connected Homes is a smart device program that leverages the technology of WiFi-connected devices into savings for its MLPs and customers. Connected Homes makes brief, limited adjustments to enrolled devices during times of peak electric demand. Customers are informed of adjustments in advance via email and are given the option to opt out. If they participate in adjustments, they will earn a monthly incentive.
Goal: The goal of this program is to reduce the amount of electricity used in HG&E’s territory during certain times when the demand and cost for electricity is highest, known as 'peak events'. Reducing demand during these times helps us maintain lower electric rates for all customers.
Details:
	•	There are typically 2-3 peak events per month, though as many as 5 could occur. These events typically occur between 4-8 pm.
	•	Incentives are received as an on-bill credit and are applied quarterly approx. 3 months after the end of each quarter based on your participation.
	•	Customers can also opt-out of an event by changing the enrolled device's temperature setting during an event but will not receive an incentive for that month.

Commercial rate customers are not allowed to participate unless a waiver is granted by the Municipal Utility. Customer must be owner/resident of the address provided in the enrollment process. Townhouse, apartment and other congregate living facilities in which the resident of the dwelling is not the electric account holder, may participate under special terms only (in which the dwelling unit resident is allowed to opt into events). Additional terms and conditions apply. Please email connectedhomes@mmwec.org for details. 
INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING BUT DON'T HAVE AN ELIGIBLE DEVICE?
If you are interested in helping HG&E reduce peak electric demand, but don't have a qualifying device, you can still participate by enrolling in our new Beat the Peak program!
