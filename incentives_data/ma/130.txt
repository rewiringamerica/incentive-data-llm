Do I Qualify for Tier I or Tier II?
	•	Tier I rebates are for SELCO customers that are also eligible to apply for Mass Save rebates OR customers that are installing a partial home unit. Tier I is also for customers that chose not to have a home energy assessment or did not complete the required weatherization measures required by the Tier II rebates.
	•	Tier II rebates are for SELCO customers who are NOT eligible for Mass Save rebates AND installed a whole home unit that has the ability to heat/cool every room in the home. Customers applying for Tier II rebates must have a home energy assessment performed and install all recommended weatherization to be eligible for the rebate. Tier II rebates also require a post installation inspection to be completed. See below for further information:

Contractors must install equipment sized to meet 90-120% of the total heating load at the outdoor design temperature, per ACCA Manual J Design Conditions, throughout 100% of the conditioned space. Homes may maintain backup heating system that will only be used during heat pump maintenance down-time or if needed during an extreme weather event. Customer must have a post installation inspection.
	▪	Homes must be occupied full time during the winter heating season.
	▪	A home energy assessment must have been performed in the last three years and the home must be sufficiently weatherized prior to heat pump installation. Sufficient weatherization can be demonstrated by satisfying at least one of the following requirements:
