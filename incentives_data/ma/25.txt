How does it work? 
Enrollment details and program requirements vary based on the type of charger you enroll: 
	•	If you have or will be installing a Level 2 ChargePoint, Enel X JuiceBox or Emporia Charger:
	◦	Customers who would like to enroll with a qualifying ChargePoint, Enel X JuiceBox or Emporia charger will need to sign up for HG&E’s ‘Connected Homes’ program administered by our energy services partner, NextZero. Through the Connected Homes program, your EV charger will be remotely adjusted a few times each month during which the charger will be incapable of charging. These adjustments will typically be made 2-3 times per month, though as many as five could occur. The hours vary depending on the season, but typically occur between 4 and 8 p.m. You will be notified of upcoming adjustments via email and/or text. The notification will include the event’s start and end times, and you will be given the opportunity to opt out if needed. Customers who choose to opt out of an adjustment will not be issued an incentive for that month. To successfully enroll in Connected Homes, your charger will need to be connected to your home Wi-Fi network and you will need to provide access to the device through a Wi-Fi connection. You will also need to agree to the Connected Homes program terms and conditions, (please review these before applying).
	▪	Incentive Details: Customers who opt to receive the free Level 2 JuiceBox charger through HG&E must have the charger installed by a licensed electrician (responsibility of the customer) and enroll the charger in the Connected Homes program within 30 days of receipt of the charger. Customers who opt to enroll an existing ChargePoint, JuiceBox or Emporia charger must first submit an application to HG&E. The rebate will be applied as an on-bill credit once HG&E confirms you have enrolled in Connected Homes.
	•	If enrolling a Level 2 charger other than ChargePoint, Enel X JuiceBox or Emporia:
	◦	To be eligible, you will need to own a Level 2 fast charger as well as an all-electric vehicle, and will need to agree to schedule Level 2 charging to occur only between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Monday-Friday, and anytime on weekends. HG&E will have the ability to monitor and verify that Level 2 charging is occurring outside of the above windows through HG&E’s Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI).
