Weatherization Program
￼View the NAED Weatherization Application (PDF).
Rebate is 50% of total project cost up to $1,000.
We encourage you to start saving energy in your home by arranging for a home energy audit to become eligible for Weatherization incentives. For more information please contact NAED at 508-643-6310 to discuss scheduling an audit. Energy New England works with NAED to ensure quality home audits utilizing updated software called "Snugg Pro" and also has advice for energy-saving appliances and home improvement ideas.
All Weatherization rebates require an audit, please call NAED prior to any work being done.
Both programs are offered only to NAED residential customers. The programs run from January 1 through December 31 each year or when annual funds are expended.
Applications for rebates and incentives are available to pick up at NAED or by calling 508-643-6310. Questions can be emailed to the Weatherization Program.
