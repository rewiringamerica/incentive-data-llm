Home Energy Audit
Fact Sheet
What is Home Energy Audit?
It is an assessment of your home's energy consumption, which identifies energy savings opportunities to help you save money, reduce your carbon footprint, and increase the overall comfort in your home throughout the seasons.
How Does It Work?
An energy auditor will walk (in-person or virtually) inside and outside of your home to determine your energy consumption and identify potential areas for improvement and provide recommendations to enhance energy efficiency. The auditor will analyze the heating and cooling systems, or HVAC system, insulation levels, as well as your appliances, lighting, and hot water heater. The auditor may also conduct a blower door test to determine your homes' air tightness. This test will detect any air leaks in the home. Please visit www.NextZero.org for more information.
Preparing for an Energy Assessment
Before the energy audit is scheduled, make a list of any concerns about your home that you might have, such as old appliances, drafty rooms, and condensation. Have copies or a summary of the home's yearly energy bills. Be prepared to walk through your home with the auditor as they work and ask any questions or express any concerns you may have.
Post Audit
You will receive an Energy Audit report that analyzes your homes energy usage and identifies home improvement projects that can lower your energy costs and possibly reduce your carbon footprint. You are also provided with your Massachusetts Home Scorecard. This scorecard compares the home's energy use and carbon footprint to an average home in MA, and shows improvements based on recommended technology.
Learn more at www.NextZero.org or call the NextZero toll-free hotline at 888-333-7525. .
