Why consider weatherizing your home?
The first step after a home energy audit should always be the most cost-effective. Usually, this means weatherizing your home by insulating the areas identified from the energy audit, and air-sealing gaps in the building envelope. These measures save homeowners money by reducing wasted energy, while also improving indoor air quality by reducing drafts and potential moisture problems.

According to the Department of Energy, air leakage in the average home adds up to a two-square-foot hole which is the equivalent of a medium-sized window left open 24 hours a day (see Energy Saver 101).






Learn more:
	•	Learn about the benefits of weatherizing your home at the Department of Energy's Home Weatherization site.
	•	Additional funding or services for low income households may also be available through Action Inc. who administers Massachusetts' Weatherization Assistance Program.
