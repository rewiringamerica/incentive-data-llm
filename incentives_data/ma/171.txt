January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022
How do I qualify for rebates from NAED?
 You must have an NAED account in good standing.  Purchase the following:
o Energy Star-certified appliance, o NEEP Certified Central AC or Ducted/Ductless ASHP, o NEEA qualified Hybrid Heat Pump Water Heater  Provide copies of all sales receipts, contractor invoices and appropriate certification from the lists below.  Mail rebates to 275 Landry Avenue, North Attleborough, MA 02760 or email to rebates@naelectric.com

How do I know my appliance is Energy Star-certified?
ENERGY STAR is the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) symbol for energy efficiency. To determine if an appliance is Energy Star-certified:
1. Look for the Energy Star logo, usually stamped on the bottom-right of the yellow Energy
Guide Label. Do not confuse the yellow label for Energy Star certification.
2. Visit https://www.energystar.gov/products/energy-star-most-efficient to lookup your product
by type and model number. No search results = not Energy Star-certified.

How do I know my appliance is NEEP-certified?
Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) Air Source Heat Pump page (https://neep.org/ashp) provides basics about the best available resources for consumers to review materials about heat pumps.

How do I know my appliance is NEEA-certified?
The Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA) is an alliance of more than 140 utilities and energy efficiency organizations working on behalf of more than 13 million energy consumers to increase the adoption of energy-efficient products, services and practices.
Please check the qualified products list below to ensure your Hybrid Heat Pump Water Heater is on the list. https://neea.org/resources/hpwh-qualified-products-list
MOW Electric! A grassroots initiated resource that offers product review and savings
calculators. Primarily focused on Vermont-based utilities, but has good information on electric products. (https://mowelectric.org/)
