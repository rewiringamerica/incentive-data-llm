Air Source Heat Pump Rebates
Install a high-efficiency heat pump—and get up to $16,000 back.

￼
Please Note: The Sponsors of Mass Save® have announced changes planned to residential heating, cooling and water heating incentives. These changes will impact incentives for eligible installations completed between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024. A complete list of 2024 Residential Heating & Cooling Incentives can be found here.
Heat pumps can efficiently heat your home in the winter and double as a cooling system in the summer - while lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
 
How Heat Pumps Work
Heat pumps consist of an outdoor unit connected to one or more indoor units by a line set, which carries heat between the two. Instead of burning fossil fuels, these highly efficient systems are powered by electricity to move - rather than create - heat to keep your home at a comfortable temperature year-round. Today's cold climate heat pumps can be up to 400% efficient and many provide efficient heating at outdoor temperatures as low as -15°F.

With our HEAT Loan, you could qualify for a loan of up to $50,000 toward qualified energy efficient home improvements with terms up to seven years, depending on your Sponsor and the loan provider. Heat pumps must be installed by a contractor participating in the Mass Save Heat Pump Installer Network in order to be eligible for HEAT Loan financing.
