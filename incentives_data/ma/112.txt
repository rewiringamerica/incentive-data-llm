Energy Audit Services
Home energy audits can provide a greater level of information to those customers wishing to implement major energy conservation projects in their home. When a customer schedules a home energy audit, an auditor will do a walkthrough of the home (in-person or virtually), review your bills, and possibly conduct an infrared scan. Based on the findings, the auditor will suggest steps the customer can take to save money and conserve energy. For more information on home energy audits, view the below audit fact sheet or call 978-531-5975 to schedule an audit.
Home Energy Audit Fact Sheet
Considering a heat pump for your home, but don’t know where to start? Schedule a heat pump assessment.
The NextZero Heat Pump Assessment Program provides PMLP customers with free expert advice and assistance with choosing a system that is optimally suited for their home.
Through CET, customers of PMLP can schedule a no-cost, no-obligation consultation with an independent heat pump expert to learn how the technology works, understand how heat pumps can reduce home heating costs, and receive guidance on using heat pumps for supplementary or whole-home heating. This assessment will ensure that the heat pump size and configuration is optimized for the customer’s home and heating and cooling goals, helping to avoid the risk of an oversized or undersized system and outsized bills.
If customers decide to purchase a heat pump after the heat pump assessment, they are eligible for heat pump rebates from PMLP. 
Customers who are interested in the Heat Pump Assessment Program can go to CET’s website for more information or call (888) 333-7525 to schedule an assessment.

Bright Ideas!
By resetting your programmable thermostat from 72 degrees to 65 degrees for eight hours a day (for instance, while no one is home or while everyone is tucked in bed) you can cut your heating bill by up to 10 percent.
