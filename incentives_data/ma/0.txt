Equipment Rebates
￼

BELD is pleased to offer rebates to customers purchasing ENERGY STAR-rated LED lights, programmable and smart thermostats, and/or ENERGY STAR appliances: refrigerators, clothes washers, clothes dryers, air conditioners, hybrid electric hot water heaters (HEHWH). These products are significantly more energy-efficient than the average comparable model.
To participate in BELD’s rebate program, access the Rebate Application Form on-line or in print (we are happy to mail you a copy, or stop by BELD’s offices to pick one up.) After you purchase an ENERGY STAR-rated appliance, return the completed form, along with a sales receipt and the EnergyGuide label, to our Energy Advisor. If you don’t have the EnergyGuide label, please include information showing the make and model of the appliance with your application
Once we get the form and verify eligibility, we will credit your electric account the rebated amount. Please allow 4-6 weeks for processing.
For all commercial rebates contact Key Accounts Representative 781.348.2370.


Energy Assessment
If you’re considering making energy improvements in your home, getting an energy assessment is the first step. Braintree residents who heat with oil or electricity should contact our Energy Advisor to schedule a free site visit. Your home’s heating and hot water systems, attic and wall insulation, appliances, windows, doors, and lighting will all be evaluated. BELD also provides financial incentives for certain types of energy upgrades, including heat pump systems. Energy audits are required to receive rebates. For more information call 781.348.1032. Gas heat customers should contact MassSave.com 1.866.527.7283.

Braintree Re-Leaf
As a participant in the American Public Power Association’s Tree Power initiative, BELD is committed to beautifying our community while helping our customers save energy. Since the Braintree Re-Leaf program started in 1992, we have planted more than 4,100 maple trees at no cost to the recipients. Each of these new trees begins to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere immediately, and in a few years the shade will help lower cooling costs.
All BELD residential customers are eligible for two free maple trees. We’ll even plant the trees for you on the south or west side of your home to ensure they get off to a healthy start. If you have not already taken advantage of this offer (sorry, no repeat customers) it’s easy to sign up. Contact the Energy Advisor 781.348.1032 and we’ll do the rest!



Tree Removal Rebate
Removing trees? You may be able to get paid!  With our tree removal rebate program customers can receive up to $500 per tree removal. If BELD determines a tree may interfere with our electrical distribution lines and you have it removed, we will send you a check after the tree has been removed.   Prior to removal contact us 781.348.BELD (2353) so we can inspect the tree and determine if the rebate applies.   Note: This rebate does not cover electrical service wire that runs from the pole to your home.
