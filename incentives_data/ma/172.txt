2023 Weatherization Incentive Program 50% of Project Cost, up to $1000
(Energy Audit required before rebate processed)
An ENERGY AUDIT (provided by NAED at no cost) will include a home energy assessment report listing energy-saving improvements that will help you reduce energy
consumption and lower your electric bill. If your home energy assessment report recommends insulation or air-sealing upgrades NAED
will rebate 50% of the job cost, up to $1000, per electric account holder, per year. Regardless of whether you choose to complete the recommended projects, NAED encourages
you to start saving energy by calling: Energy New England at 888-772-4242 to schedule your ENERGY AUDIT or use the links
below to set up an audit online. Online Intake form Link - Email: hea@ene.org
An ENERGY AUDIT of your home includes information on heating and hot water systems, shell insulation, appliances, windows, doors and lighting. An energy conservation specialist conducts the audit by walking through the home, demonstrating ways to save energy. After
the audit, a computerized report is given to the homeowner recommending improvements that save energy. (Virtual Audits maybe available)

SnuggPro is the newest software in Residential Conservation Services. Our auditors enter dozens of data points about your home and the SnuggPro software models potential energy-saving measures, along with ROI on those measures.
