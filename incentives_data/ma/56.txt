2023 Residential Weatherization Incentive Program
MMED's Residential Weatherization Incentive Program is designed to assist residential customers to offset the cost to purchase energy efficiency measures that reduce overall energy costs. All eligible measures through this program must come from a recommendation made in the ENE Home Energy Assessment audit. MMED will rebate 50% (up to max. $1,000) on all weatherization measures installed. To start the process, the customer is to complete the following steps:

1. Call the toll-free ENE hotline at 888-772-4242 to schedule a free Home Energy Assessment audit. An energy conservation specialist will make recommendations for customers to make energy efficiency improvements.
2. Schedule a post audit inspection (by calling the ENE hotline at 888-772-4242) once the identified energy efficiency measures are installed.
3. Submit their application and sales receipts along with the pre and post audit results.

Eligibility requirements for rebate include the following:  Must be a MMED residential customer of record  Each measure must be recommended by ENE Home Energy Assessment audit & have a Savings to Investment Ratio
(SIR) of greater than one (1). The more cost effective a measure is, the higher the SIR.  Doors, windows, taxes and non-professional labor (e.g. DIY labor) are not eligible for rebate.  Measures must be purchased between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023 & application postmarked by 1/31/24

Rebates $500 or less will be applied directly to the active customer account as a credit. For rebates of more than $500, the customer will have the option of receiving a refund check. Please allow 6-8 weeks for processing.
