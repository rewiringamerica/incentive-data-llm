In Our Community:
The Ipswich Electric Light Department, and The Town of Ipswich are committed to reducing green house gas emissions by not only adding EVs to our own fleet, but by arming our residents with information and incentives that could make getting an EV possible.

There are currently two charging stations available for public use in Ipswich at a rate of $1.25/hour. These stations are conveniently located at 12 Hammatt Street and 44 So Main Street.
