Smart Thermostats

Focus on Year-Round Comfort
A smart thermostat can save energy by learning your householdâ€™s patterns and automatically adjusting your homeâ€™s temperature settings throughout the day, keeping your home cool and comfortable when you need it and warmer when you do not. Many also have the advantage of being adjusted and programmed via an app, allowing you to control them from your smart phone, tablet, or computer. ENERGY STARÂ® certified smart thermostats can help you improve home comfort any time of year.
