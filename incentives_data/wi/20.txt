                         INTERRUPTIBLE SERVICE - WATER HEATER

This agreement made and executed ______Date_______ by and between Chippewa Valley Electric
Cooperative, headquartered in Cornell, Wisconsin (hereinafter referred to as the 'Cooperative'), and

______________Member Name______________________                                   (hereinafter referred to as the 'member').

It is agreed by and between the parties as follows:
    1. The participant must have installed, powered on and operating, a 50 gallon, or larger, electric water
         heater to be used for residential or commercial water heating or for water heating in a milk house or

         milk parlor, and specifically excludes tankless, or "on demand" electric water heaters.

2. The Cooperative shall furnish and install all control devices on the outside of the structure which shall
     remain the property of the Cooperative. The Member shall permit the Cooperative and its agents and
     employees to enter upon premises for purpose of installing, maintaining, relocating, repairing, replacing
     and removing said devices and appurtenances thereto.

3. The Cooperative shall have the authority to interrupt service taken under the selected Interruptible Rate
     Schedule, recognizing that the Cooperative may modify the terms and conditions of the selected
     Interruptible Rate Schedule from time to time as required by its load characteristics.

4. If the Cooperative determines or suspects that electric energy usage has not been consistent with this
     Agreement, Interruptible Rate Schedule, service rules or specifications, all control devices may be
     removed and all electric service billed under the general rate schedule. Only active, monthly billed,
     residential accounts, where the control device is installed, and purchased at least 500 kilowatt
     hours per month, may qualify for the monthly $3.00 credit.

5. The Cooperative shall not be liable for any economic loss or personal discomfort due to the operation of
     the control device or the period of the service interruption.

6. Problems occurring with controlled loads shall be analyzed and corrected by an electrician. The member
     shall immediately notify the Cooperative if the control device is not functioning. The Cooperative will
     reimburse the homeowner or electrician for reasonable costs, only if the problem was with the control
     device.

7. If the control device is removed by the Cooperative and the interruptible rate discontinued for any
     reason, twelve months shall elapse before the control device and interruptible rate can be used by the
     Member again.

8. This Agreement shall be in effect upon the date it was executed until cancelled by either party at any
     time after one year from the date of this contract, for any reason. If member requests removal from
     Interruptible Service program before 12 months have passed, member will forfeit the water heater
     rebate and be invoiced for that rebate amount.

9. This Agreement shall be binding and inure to the benefit of the successors, legal representatives and
     assigns of the respective parties.
