ELIGIBILITY AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THIS FORM (Please read)

 Member may qualify for 20% of the cost of energy efficiency improvements up to $500 (cost can only include material and professional labor).

 Energy Efficiency improvements must be recommended during an audit or assessment arranged by your cooperative or a cooperative approved partner. The audit

      must be a comprehensive audit including a written report.

 Home or farm being improved must be on cooperative's lines.

 Rebates are in place through December 13, 2024, or until funds are depleted. Funds are limited so members are encouraged to submit as soon as possible.

 The audit report must indicate the improvement will result in electrical or delivered fossil fuels (LP, oil) reduction or efficiency.

 If another incentive is available, the audit recommended improvement will qualify for only that incentive. For example, if an auditor recommends purchasing an

      Energy Star refrigerator, the refrigerator will qualify for the Appliance incentive, not the Audit Recommended Improvements incentive.

 Each Member account qualifies for only 1 Audit Recommended Improvement incentive every 5 years, regardless of the number of audits performed and regardless of

      the number of measures implemented.

 The incentive for qualifying rebates will appear as a bill credit unless the incentive is greater than $200 in which case a check may be issued.

 The following deadlines apply:

                         Energy efficiency improvements must be completed within 24 months of the audit date.

                         After improvements are completed, apply for rebate within 3 months of completion date, or by December 13, 2024, whichever date comes

                        first.
