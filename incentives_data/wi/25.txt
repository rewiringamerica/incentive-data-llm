This institution is an equal opportunity provider.                          2024 Energy Efficiency Incentive Form

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

 Home or farm being improved must be on cooperative's lines.

 Incentive not to exceed the cost of energy efficiency improvements, up to $500. Cost can include material and professional labor. The cost of the

      audit cannot be included.

 Energy efficiency improvements must be recommendations from an audit arranged by your cooperative or a cooperative-approved partner.

 The audit must be a comprehensive audit, including a written report.

 The audit report must indicate the improvement will result in electrical or delivered fossil fuels (LP, oil) reduction or efficiency.

 If another incentive is available, the audit recommended improvement will qualify for only that incentive. For example, if an auditor recommends

      purchasing an ENERGY STAR refrigerator, the refrigerator will qualify for the Appliance incentive, not the Audit Recommended Improvements

      incentive.

 Improvements must be completed within 24 months of the audit date.

 Each member account qualifies for only 1 Audit Recommended Improvement incentive every 5 years, regardless of the number of audits

      performed and regardless of the number of measures implemented.

 Incentives are in place through December 31, 2024. Funds are limited so submit the required documentation as soon as possible.

 Required documentation must be submitted within 3 months of implementation of audit recommended improvements.

 Additional eligibility criteria may apply. Program is subject to change or cancellation without notice. Contact cooperative for details.

 Required documentation listed below must be submitted no later than 3 months after improvements are completed.
