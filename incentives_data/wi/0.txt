Insulation & Air Sealing Rebates

Ready to insulate your home?
One of the best ways to improve comfort, lower your energy costs, and boost efficiency in your home is through insulation and air sealing. These home improvement projects can also help remedy and protect against ice dam issues in the winter and air quality issues year-round. Focus on Energy offers rebates to bring down the cost of insulation and air sealing, and a list of Trade Ally contractors to help you complete the project with ease. Or, if you prefer a hands-on approach to home improvement, check out our available DIY Rebates.
Note: Insulation must be installed by a participating insulation Trade Ally contractor to be eligible for standard rebates.

Consider an Energy Assessment
To achieve the greatest benefits, itâ€™s best to look at your home as a system with many different parts working together. A home energy assessment will identify areas in your home that cause drafts, discomfort, high energy bills, and will also look at health and safety issues. Trained and certified Trade Ally contractors perform the energy assessments, which typically range between $500-$700 dollarsâ€”in return youâ€™ll gain access to higher rebates for improvements you chose to make.
Trade Ally contractors that perform energy assessments are listed under "Home Energy Assessments" in the Find a Trade Ally tool. Often, they partner with, or perform insulation services themselves.

How an Energy Assessment Works
Using special diagnostic tools, such as a blower door test, our Trade Ally contractors can locate any air leakage sites and other trouble areas. Youâ€™ll walk away with a clear road map of:
	•	Where your home is performing well, and where you could benefit from efficiency improvements.
	•	Specific solutions for comfort, health, and safety issues, as well as ideas for lowering energy costs.
	•	Available financial rebates that cover assessment cost and provide funding for additional work.
From there, you can determine which improvements to make, like adding insulation to your attic or walls.
