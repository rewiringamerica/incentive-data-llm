Rebates and Incentives
￼

Your rebate may be denied if all required documentation is not completed and received and your purchase is beyond 60 days of the invoice date.
Jackson Electric Cooperative offers rebates to its members who purchase qualified energy efficient items. These rebates are paid from the Commitment to Community (Public Benefits Funds) dollars that are collected each month from each member account. This is a state mandated program where half of the dollars are used toward low-income energy programs and the remaining half toward energy efficiency programs.
Availability of rebates are subject to change without notice.
Please submit to our office your completed and signed rebate reward form within 60 days of your invoice date with the Energy Star label (if applicable) and paid receipt. Your rebate application may be rejected if all required documentation is not completed, signed, and received.
Rebate amounts less than $500 will be issued a credit on the member's billing statement. More than that amount, a check will be issued to the member on record.
