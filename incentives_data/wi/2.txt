Water Heating

￼

Water heaters account for almost 20% of the energy used in the average homeâ€”more than a refrigerator, dishwasher, clothes washer, and dryer combined. An important element of an ENERGY STARÂ® Home Upgrade is a heat pump water heater that earns the ENERGY STAR label. These units are up to four times more efficient and use 70% less energy than a standard model*. An efficient water heater can save homeowners up to $300 per year.  *energystar.gov
Focus on Energy provides instant discounts on qualifying heat pump water heaters and tankless water heaters when purchased from a participating Trade Ally. To get your discount, contact one of our participating Trade Allies and ask about eligible models. *Instant discounts are exclusively offered through participating Trade Allies. Focus on Energy does not offer instant discounts for water heaters purchased through nonparticipating Trade Allies or on equipment previously installed.

Signs It's Time for an Upgrade
Focus on Efficient Water Heating
	•	Your water heater is more than 10 years old.
	•	You notice your hot water isnâ€™t lasting as long as it used to.
	•	You see rust or discoloration in your water.
	•	You notice water is leaking from the tank.
	•	You start to hear rumbling noises coming from your water heater.
￼
Eligible Equipment
Heat Pump Water Heaters
To maximize efficiency, ENERGY STAR certified electric heat pump water heaters use a high-efficiency heat pump to transfer heat from the surrounding air to the water. Learn more about how to keep costs low and water temperatures high with a heat pump water heater.
	•	Instant discounts for electric heat pump water heaters start at $300.
	•	Call your Trade Ally for more information about this equipment and how to receive the instant discount.

Indirect Water Heaters
Residences and businesses may qualify for rebates when installing an indirect water heater with an eligible boiler. For more information, visit our Multifamily catalog, Residential catalog, or Business catalog.
Tankless Water Heaters
Natural gas tankless water heaters heat water as it is needed and for as long as you need it, helping to save 25%-50% in water heating costs over a standard tank-type heater. These water heaters donâ€™t have a tank, so they are less susceptible to leaks and they have a more compact design. An ENERGY STAR certified gas tankless water heater has a secondary heat exchanger which uses about 9% less energy than a conventional gas tankless unit.
	•	Instant discounts for natural gas tankless water heaters start at $120.
	•	Call your Trade Ally for more information about this equipment and how to receive the discount.
