Residential EV charger pilot program
Overview
Our electric vehicle (EV) charger pilot program can help you with the costs of EV chargers and charging. We provide the charging equipment and maintenance, and you have the option to:
	•	Install the charger yourself or have us install it for you.
	•	Pay for charging equipment and installation upfront or as a monthly cost on your energy bill.

Pilot programs
The pilot program is based on your current residential rate class. Customers must obtain a Level 2 charger through our program in order to participate.
	•	Charger-only EV program Standard residential rate (Rg-1) customers This program allows customers on our standard residential rate (Rg-1) to obtain an EV charger and take service for it under a three-part Time-of-Use rate specially designed for an EV charger load. The remainder of the customerâ€™s load will remain on the standard rate.
	•	Whole-house EV program Existing Time-of-Use rates (Rg3-OTOU, Rg5-OTOU or Rg-RR) customers This program allows customers on our existing Time-of-Use rates (Rg3-OTOU, Rg5-OTOU or Rg-RR) to obtain a charger and have the usage billed under their existing rate. Customers on generation rates are only eligible for this option.

Eligibility requirements
All of the following requirements must be met to take part in the pilot program.
	1	Electric vehicle: Own or lease an electric vehicle (all-electric or plug-in hybrid).
	2	Wisconsin residence: Own and live in a Wisconsin residence that receives electric service from Wisconsin Public Service (WPS). (For this program, this is defined as a detached single-family home, townhome/row house, duplex or other multifamily dwellings with separately metered service.)
	3	Wi-Fi: Have adequate Wi-Fi at the charging location.
	4	240-volt circuit: Have 240-volt circuit wiring and outlet where the charger will be located. Your home may need additional electrical upgrades to meet this requirement.
	5	Good standing: Must be in good standing (i.e., cannot have any late payments or disconnections in the past 12 months).

Questions and answers
Pricing
How does the electricity pricing in this program work?
With your EV charger on a Time-of-Use rate, the price you pay for electricity to charge your EV depends on the time of day you charge it. Your bill amount will depend on how much electricity you use to charge your EV and when you charge it.  Charger-OnlyFor customers on our standard residential rate (Rg-1). Your EV charging will be billed on an EV Time-of-Use rate, and the rest of the electricity you use in your home will continue to be billed at the standard rate.  Whole-HouseFor customers on our existing Time-of-Use ratesÂ (Rg3-OTOU, Rg5-OTOU or Rg-RR). All of your home electricity use, including your EV charging, will be billed on your current Time-of-Use rate.  Your Level 2 charger may be programmed to charge only during off-peak hours, which means your EV will be charging during the lowest-cost time period.
What is included in the WPS installation?
The pilot program installation cost includes the setup of the Level 2 charger. The pilot program does not include any additional electrical work, such as circuit wiring or panel upgrades, which may be required to set up your charging location for a 240-volt circuit.
How much does additional circuit wiring or a panel upgrade typically cost?
Costs depend on your homeâ€™s electrical setup and wiring. A qualified electrician can help you understand the actual costs of any additional work unique to your home.
Do I need to have an additional meter installed?
No, an additional meter is not required for the program.
What is the difference between Prepay and Bundled payment options?
You can choose Prepay, which means you would pay for the charging equipment upfront. If you chose the Bundled option, you lease the charger. Nothing is due upfront, and you pay higher monthly program fee on your energy bill to cover the cost of the equipment.
What is included in the monthly program fee?
The monthly program fee reflects the actual costs of operating and maintaining the EV charging equipment and of administering the residential EV program. The monthly charge will be higher for customers who choose to pay for the charger and installation over time under the Bundled payment option.
Eligibility
What if I already own a Level 2 charger?
Any existing Level 2 charger, or one obtained outside of our program, is not eligible for the programâ€™s EV charging rate. Customers must obtain the Level 2 charger through us via the program to receive the EV charging rate.  If you donâ€™t qualify for this pilot program, you may still have your homeâ€™s electric use put on our existing/established Time-of-Use rate.
Can I participate if I rent my home or live in a multifamily dwelling?
To participate in this pilot program, customers must own and live in a single-family home, defined as a detached single-family home, townhome/row house, duplex or other multifamily dwelling with separately metered service.
Are solar customers eligible for the program?
Solar customers are eligible to participate in the pilot program under the Whole-House program rate. Due to metering limitations, solar customers cannot enroll in the Charger-Only rate. To enroll in the pilot program, you may need to switch your homeâ€™s electricity to our Time-of-Use rate. All of your usage, including that of your EV charger, would be on the same Time-of-Use rate.
General
Do you offer rebates for purchasing EVs?
No. Our pilot program does not offer financial incentives. Check these resources for other consumer programs that may be available. Go Electric Drive Wisconsin Clean Cities
How long will it take to be enrolled in the program?
It will vary with each customer and depends if additional electrical upgrade work is needed.
What types of at-home EV chargers are there?
At home, people typically charge EVs with a Level 1 or Level 2 charger. A Level 1 charger can provide 4 to 6 miles of range for every hour of charging. EVs usually come with a standard Level 1 charger that plugs into a typical household outlet (120-volt). A Level 2 charger provides faster and more convenient charging, with 25 to 40 miles of range for every hour of charging. They require a dedicated 240-volt circuit.
