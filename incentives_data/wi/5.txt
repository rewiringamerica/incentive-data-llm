Heating & Cooling

￼
Enjoy Year-Round Comfort and Savings
When you consider that heating and cooling accounts for nearly half of an average homeâ€™s energy usage, itâ€™s easy to see how important it is that your heating and cooling equipment is running efficiently. Efficient equipment typically consumes 10%-30% less fuel, is quieter, and maintains more consistent temperatures in the home.
If you are looking for new heating and/or cooling equipment, Focus on Energy offers rebates and resources to help you make the most of your investment. Choose from a variety of energy-saving options, including a new furnace, boiler, smart thermostat, or water heater. You can receive rebates for each individual improvement or make multiple upgrades at once and increase your rebates and energy savings. Find a Trade Ally contractor to install your new equipment and help you apply for your rebates.

Considering a Heat Pump?
Heat pumps use the refrigeration cycle to move heat from one place to another. In the home, this means pumping heat out of the house in summer, and pumping heat into the house in winter. Heat pumps can be upwards of 300%â€“400% efficient because they move heat instead of generating it. They offer substantial annual energy, and utility bill, savings.

Dual-Fuel Heat Pumps
A dual-fuel system pairs an electric heat pump with a new or existing furnace. It does exactly what your air conditioner does, except it provides heat too! Dual-fuel heat pumps allow you to take advantage of cost savings from both technologies: efficient heating from your heat pump in mild temperatures as well as cheaper natural gas from your furnace on the coldest days of the year.

Signs That it's Time for an Upgrade
	•	Your heating and cooling equipment is unreliable, inefficient, or over 15 years old.
	•	Youâ€™ve noticed excessive blower noises, or sporadic pops, bangs, or rattles from your furnace.

Residential Heating and Cooling Program Requirements
	•	Must be a customer of a participating utility. Focus on Energy rebates are available to Wisconsin residential customers of participating utilities. Verify your utility at: focusonenergy.com/about/participating-utilities.
	•	Offer is valid for eligible equipment and products purchased and installed between January 1 and May 31, 2024.
	•	Only single-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings with three or fewer units under a single roof, or a multifamily dwelling of four or more units under a single roof where the heating/cooling equipment only heats/cools a single dwelling, are eligible for rebates included in this application. Rebates may be available for other customer or property types. Please visit focusonenergy.com/business for more information.
	•	Any project with an expected rebate exceeding $10,000 requires pre-approval BEFORE project initiation or equipment purchase to guarantee fund availability. Projects not receiving pre-approval will be subject to funding availability.
	•	Rebates are limited to $400,000 per customer per calendar year for all Focus on Energy rebates.
	•	Rebates may not exceed the total purchase price of the energy-efficient equipment. The only costs eligible for rebates are: materials, equipment, and external labor.
	•	Allow approximately 8-10 weeks for your completed application to be processed. Incomplete applications cannot be processed. Failure to complete the application in full and provide the required supporting documentation will either delay the payment process or result in your application being denied. Receipt of an application does not guarantee payment of a rebate.
	•	The program is not responsible for items (i.e., applications, supporting documentation, rebate checks) lost or damaged in the mail.
	•	Focus on Energy will only pay one rebate for each piece of equipment. Rebates paid on this application cannot be claimed on another Focus on Energy application.
	•	Similarly, rebates can only be paid to one person or entity (i.e., either the resident or landlord, not both).
	•	You cannot receive a rebate from both the standard and income-qualified offerings.
	•	All equipment installations are subject to verification inspection by the program to ensure the equipment is properly installed and operating.
	•	Participants must allow, if requested, the program or a program representative reasonable access to their home to verify the installed equipment.
	•	A current list of qualified products for most equipment is available at focusonenergy.com/residential/heating-and-cooling. If you have a question concerning one of the lists, please email homerewards@focusonenergy.com with â€œEquipmentâ€ in the subject line.
You Are Only Eligible To Participate in the Program if You Are:
	•	A current residential customer of a participating utility in Wisconsin at the time of equipment purchase and installation; or
	•	A landlord (who is not the utility account holder) who paid for the equipment installed in the residence of a current residential customer of a participating utility in Wisconsin at the time of equipment purchase and installation; and
	•	Installing qualifying energy-efficient equipment in an existing residential dwelling. New construction does not qualify for these rebates. Visit focusonenergy.com/residential/new-home-certification to learn about new home certification.

	•	It meets all equipment-specific, energy efficiency, and program requirements as outlined in our eligibility guidelines by equipment type (see Equipment Eligibility tab).
	•	It is replacing existing equipment used for the same purposes. Equipment additions to a residential dwelling, which are not replacing existing equipment, do not qualify.
	•	It is purchased new. Resale material or material that is leased, rebuilt, rented, received from insurance claims, received from a manufacturer warranty, purchased through Focus on Energy, or won as a prize does not qualify. Equipment purchased with a home warranty is eligible if the rebate does not exceed the total purchase price of the energy-efficient equipment less the home warranty reimbursement.
	•	Equipment is installed by a professional contractor with appropriate insurance, permits, and licenses. A valid Wisconsin State professional contractorâ€™s license or credential is required.
