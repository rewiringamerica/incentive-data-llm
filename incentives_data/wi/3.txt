Solar for Homes

Reach Next Level Savings
If you have already put in the work to make your home or multifamliy building as energy efficient as possible, now is the perfect time to take the next step by installing a solar electric system. To help, Focus on Energy offers cash rebates for qualified solar electric installations.
Solar electric systems, also known as photovoltaic (PV) systems, use sunlight to generate electricity. To capture sunlight, solar panels or modules are strategically placed on roofs or ground mounted to maximize exposure to the sun. Systems are silent, very reliable, and require little ongoing maintenance.

	•	Funding is limited and available on an annual first-come, first-served basis.
	•	The program is not responsible for items (i.e., applications, supporting documentation, rebate checks) lost or damaged in the mail.
	•	Focus on Energy will only pay one rebate per site (residential) or meter (non-residential) per calendar year. Rebates paid on this application cannot be claimed on another Focus on Energy application. Similarly, rebates can only be paid to one person or entity.
	•	All equipment installations are subject to verification inspection by the program to ensure the equipment is properly installed and operating. Participants must allow, if requested, the program or a program representative reasonable access to their home or business to verify the installed equipment.
	•	For specific equipment eligibility, please visit the "Equipment Eligibility" tab of this page.
	•	The system is purchased new. Resale equipment, new parts installed in existing equipment, or equipment that is leased, rebuilt, rented, received from insurance claims, received from a warranty, received from a grant, or won as a prize do not qualify.
	•	Equipment is installed by a professional contractor with a valid Wisconsin State professional contractorâ€™s license, appropriate insurance, and permits.
	•	Equipment is installed conforming to all applicable building, local, state and federal codes, standards, ordinances and regulations, and manufacturer specifications.
	•	The system is installed in a property owned by the applicant, or the applicant has received permission from the property owner to install the equipment. If you do not own the property where this equipment is installed, as a residing tenant you are responsible for obtaining the ownerâ€™s permission to install the equipment for which you are applying for a rebate. Your submission of this application indicates that you have obtained this permission.
	•	All necessary utility service improvement costs are the responsibility of the customer.
	•	All necessary service improvement costs, including transformers and service lines, are the responsibility of the customer.
	•	System installations must be in compliance with all state, local and federal codes, standards and requirements, including any and all applicable utility standards.

	•	System owners and installers must obtain all required permits.
	•	If the project site is serviced by a participating Focus on Energy utility and uses a non-residential rate, the project site does not have to be owned by the applicant. The project/system equipment, however, must be owned by the applicant in order to qualify and confirmation of this ownership should be provided. System ownership must revert to the property owner after a specified period of time, not to exceed 25 years.
	•	In order to receive a commercial rebate, the system must be connected through a non-residential rate meter.
	•	Allow approximately 8-10 weeks for your completed application to be processed. Incomplete applications cannot be processed. Failure to complete the application in full and provide the required supporting documentation will either delay the payment process or result in your application being denied. Receipt of an application does not guarantee payment of a rebate.
	•	Focus on Energy will only pay one incentive for each piece of equipment. Incentives paid on this application cannot be claimed on another Focus on Energy application. Similarly, incentives can only be paid to one person or entity (i.e., either the resident or landlord, not both).
