FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


CHARGER INFORMATION
What is a Level 2 charger?
+
There are two common household levels of EV charging - Level 1 and 2. Level 1 - Can provide 4 to 6 miles range for every hour of charging. EVs come with a standard Level 1 charger that plugs into a typical household outlet (120-volt). Level 2 - Faster and more convenient charging, providing 25 to 40 miles range for every hour of charging. Needs a dedicated 240-volt circuit (like an electric clothes dryer).
What if I already own a Level 2 charger?
+
If you own either a ChargePoint Home Flex or Enel X Way JuiceBox charger, you may be able to participate in this program. Please select the customer-owned charger option on the enrollment application and we will send an electrician to your home to ensure that your charging station qualifies. You will be responsible for installing 240-volt circuit wiring, from the panel to the charger location, if needed. There is a monthly data and service fee of $7.00 to gain access to electricity pricing that can save you money on off-peak charging. You will be responsible for the maintenance of the charger. Currently, other Level 2 chargers are not compatible with the program.
Where do I find my charger's ID or serial number?
+
Here is a guide with instructions on how to find your ChargePoint Home Flex serial number or Enel X Way JuiceBox ID number and your meter number.
If you are still having issues finding this information, please contact an Electric Vehicle Advisor at 800.895.4999.
What if my charger malfunctions?
+
A common fix for most issues is to turn the charger on and off. Start by turning the power to the charger off by flicking the breaker switch in your electric panel. Wait 5 minutes, then turn the power back on. Your charger should automatically reconnect to your Wi-Fi and resume charging as originally scheduled. Xcel Energy-Provided Charger: If this troubleshooting process does not work, please contact us at ElectricVehicles@xcelenergy.com then contact the charger manufacturer at the phone number below. Describe the issue and indicate that you are participating in the Xcel Energy EV Accelerate At Home program. The manufacturer will help troubleshoot and work with you to identify the resolution. Please take note of the ticket number that you receive from the manufacturer in case that information is needed in the future.  Customer-Owned Charger: Contact your manufacturer at the number below, they will help troubleshoot and will work with you to identify the resolution. Xcel Energy does not provide maintenance for your charger.  ChargePoint Support 877-850-4562 Enel X Way Support 844-584-2329
Why are only two Level 2 chargers eligible for this program?
+
Through a formal vetting and approval process, we selected chargers that fulfilled program requirements of providing access to your charging data while keeping your bills low. We use this charging data to bill your EV energy use at the discounted rate for off-peak charging. As technologies change and improve, we will continue to explore additional options for customers to participate in this program.
INSTALLATION PROCESS
What is included in the installation service?
+
The installation service in this program only includes the set-up and hardwiring of the Level 2 charger. This service does not include permit fees or any additional electrical work such as circuit wiring or any circuit rework needed to ensure charger compatibility, or panel upgrades, which may be required to set up your charging location for a 240-volt circuit
What is included in the inspection service with customer-owned charger?
+
The inspection service in this program only includes the set-up and hardwiring of the Level 2 charger and verifying charger eligibility. This service does not include permit fees or any additional electrical work, such as circuit wiring or any circuit rework needed to ensure charger compatibility, or panel upgrades, which may be required to set up your charging location for a 240-volt circuit.
What if the electrician determines my charging station does not qualify?
+
If a qualified electrician inspects your charger and determines it does not qualify, the electrician and/or Xcel Energy will notify you on next steps you would need to take to participate in this program. You can still rent an Xcel Energy charging station if yours does not qualify.
How much does additional circuit wiring or panel upgrades typically cost?
+
The program cost does not include additional circuit wiring that may be required to add a new 240-volt outlet. Those costs depend on your homeâ€™s unique electrical setup and wiring. Our electricians can help you understand the actual costs of any additional work unique to your home. To complete any additional electrical work, you can use our electrician and pay them directly or choose another electrician.
If I'm accepted into the program, when will my charging station be installed?
+
Once you receive an email confirmation that you are accepted into the program, an electrician from Xcel Energyâ€™s network will contact you within 2 business days to schedule installation typically within 4 weeks. You or your authorized representative (over 18) must be present during the appointment. These timelines are rough estimates and subject to change. If you are also installing a separate meter and service for the charger, this may take 6 weeks or more.
If I'm accepted into the customer-provided option, when will my benefits start?
+

How does the electricity pricing in this program work?
+
With EV Accelerate At Home, the price of the electricity you use to charge your EV varies depending on the time of day. That means your bill will depend on how much electricity you use to charge your EV and when you charge it. (The electricity you use in your home will continue to be billed at your current rate.)
Your Level 2 charger will be programmed to charge only during off-peak hours, between midnight and 6 a.m. So, you can rest assured that your EV is automatically charging during the lowest cost time period. No need to go to the garage at midnight to plug in!
If you need to occasionally charge your EV during other times, you can easily adjust your charging schedule. Details about adjusting the scheduled charging time are found in the FAQ â€œWhat if I need to adjust my scheduled charging time?
If you would like more information on reading your bill, click here to see a Bill Explainer.
What if I need to adjust my scheduled charging time?
+
If you need to occasionally charge your EV outside your selected charging schedule, you can easily adjust your scheduled charging time.
	•	Through your charger: Use your charger manufacturer's app to override the scheduled charging time and charge immediately. (Tesla drivers will use the Tesla app vs charger app.)
	◦	If you have a ChargePoint Charger, you can "double pump" the charger by plugging in, unplugging and plugging back into the car charging port.
	▪	Your charger will revert to your scheduled charging time the next time you plug in your EV.
	◦	Enel X Way Juicebox - you will need to go through the EV JuiceNet Mobile App
	▪	From the main menu, swipe to the right.
	•	Through your vehicle: You'll adjust your charging schedule through your vehicle's app.
If you would like to choose a different charging schedule, please contact us at ElectricVehicles@xcelenergy.com. ElectricVehicles@xcelenergy.com.

What is included in charger maintenance and warranty?

If you rent the charger from us and stay in the program, ongoing maintenance is included in your monthly fee and you are eligible for a lifetime warranty for your charger. Maintenance is not included for customers who bring their own charger.
What if I am not able to charge my EV overnight?
+
You may still participate in this program, but it will likely not be the best option for you. The program is designed for EV drivers who can charge their vehicles overnight when energy prices are the lowest. However, if you need to occasionally charge your EV during peak and mid-peak times, you will have that option, but you will be charged at the higher rates.
What If I am moving and would like to take my charger?
+
Xcel Energy-Provided Charger: Please contact us at ElectricVehicles@xcelenergy.com at least 60 days prior to the moving date.

How can I enroll more than once?
+
To enroll in EV Accelerate At Home more than once at the same premise/account you must apply through a "guest" account (see below steps). Currently, you will receive an error if the second enrollment is done through MyAccount.
