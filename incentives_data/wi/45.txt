This institution is an equal opportunity provider.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

 New equipment must be installed on cooperative's lines.

 Incentive not to exceed the equipment cost.

 Incentives not allowed for a measure and a component of that measure. For example, if an air source heat pump has a variable speed blower

      motor, the air source heat pump qualifies for an incentive but not the variable speed blower motor.

 Incentives are in place through December 31, 2024. Funds are limited so submit required documentation as soon as possible.

 Required documentation must be submitted within 3 months of install date. If submitted after December 31, 2024, equipment will be considered

      for the 2025 incentive if offered.

 Additional eligibility criteria may apply. Program is subject to change or cancellation without notice. Contact cooperative for details.

 Required documentation listed below must be submitted no later than 3 months after install date.
