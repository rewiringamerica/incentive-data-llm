RENEW Wisconsin’s EVs for Good initiative fosters the expansion of electric vehicles among mission-based nonprofits in Wisconsin. RENEW supports transitioning our state’s vehicles away from fossil fuels and onto clean, renewable electricity sources.
Thanks to a generous partnership with Carol and Andy Phelps, RENEW Wisconsin awards grants to nonprofit organizations interested in purchasing an electric vehicle. EVs for Good works to reduce the upfront costs of purchasing an electric vehicle, while reducing vehicle maintenance costs and transportation emissions. EVs for Good also offers small grants for organizations seeking to install electric vehicle charging equipment.
Organizations that receive an EVs for Good grant work with RENEW Wisconsin to promote their awards and educate their communities about the benefits of electric transportation.
EVs for Good applications will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis until all grant funds are reserved.
