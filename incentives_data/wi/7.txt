ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

 Equipment must be installed in 2024.
 Installed equipment must be on cooperative's lines.
 Rebate not to exceed 20% of the cost of the equipment.
 Rebates not allowed for a measure and a component of that measure. For example, if an air source heat pump has a variable speed blower motor,

      the air source heat pump qualifies for a rebate but not the variable speed blower motor.
 Rebates are in place through December 13, 2024, or until funds are depleted. Funds are limited so members are encouraged to submit as soon as

      possible.
 The incentive for qualifying rebates will appear as a bill credit unless the incentive is greater than $200 in which case a check may be issued.

      Rebates greater than $200 may be subject to an inspection performed by the cooperative.
 All documentation listed below must be submitted no later than 3 months after installation date, or by December 13, 2024, whichever date comes

      first.
