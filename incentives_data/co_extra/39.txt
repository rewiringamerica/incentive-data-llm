Overview
Upgrade your home with Denver's Home Energy Rebates! These rebates can help you
	•	Get new, more efficient heating and cooling equipment for your home
	•	Get home upgrades that make it easier to stop using natural gas
	•	Improve your home's indoor air quality
Rebates are available for owners of single family homes, duplexes, and townhomes in Denver. If you own another type of building, such as a commercial or larger multifamily building, you can qualify for our Building Electrification Rebates. 
The rebates act as an instant reduction in cost for homeowners - the contractor you work with will deduct the rebate upfront from the project's cost. No need to pay full price and wait for a reimbursement later! Note that all rebates require pre-approval before the work begins. You may also be able to stack these rebates with tax incentives and other rebates from Xcel Energy, The State and Federal government, and the Inflation Reduction Act. 
How to Get Started
Make a Plan for Your Home
Not sure how to get started with your rebates? This step-by-step guide will help you get started with navigating this process. More information for contractors and installers can be found on on our Contractor Resources Hub.
1. Get an energy audit. An energy audit will help you identify the most effective steps you can take to improve energy efficiency and comfort in your home. Xcel Energy provides low-cost energy audits to home owners, along with a wealth of resources. While an energy audit is not a requirement for getting a rebate from Denver, we do recommend it as a place to get started. Be sure to consider other utility programs at this stage of the project including Xcel Energy's Whole Home Efficiency Program or their Energy Advisor service.

	•	Whole Home Efficiency
	•	Home Energy Audits
	•	Energy Advisor Service

2. Based on the results of your energy audit, consider adding insulation or air sealing your home. This will increase your home's comfort and tends to be more affordable. Often, people living in poorly insulated or leaky homes end up having to get larger heating and cooling equipment to make up for all the conditioned air that escapes. By adding insulation to your home you may be able to reduce the size of heating and cooling equipment and save money on both utility bills and new equipment.

3. Research and choose the equipment you want to install. If your furnace, air conditioner or water heater is more than 10 years old, it’s time to start making a plan for replacement. Check out Heat Pumps 101 to learn more about the different kinds of equipment available. 

	•	Heat Pumps 101
	•	Heat Pump Buying Guide

4. Once you have picked the equipment you think you want to install, you will need to find a contractor to work with who will help you evaluate the best options for your home, complete the installation, and ensure everything is working correctly. We keep a list of registered contractors who are eligible to work within this rebate program. If you’d like to work with someone who is not yet listed they can register to offer rebates. We recommend that you get at least three quotes from three different contractors so that you can make the best decision about who to work with and what work needs to be done. Our Heat Pump Buying Guide gives you a great list of questions to ask along the way as you work with a contractor.

	•	Heat Pump Buying Guide

5. Once you have gotten quotes from approved contractors, you can decide which contractor to work with. Make sure to emphasize that you're interested in using Denver's Home Energy Rebates and Xcel Energy's rebates. Denver's Home Energy Rebates requires that your installer gets pre-approval for the your rebate before starting the work. Your installer will work with us directly to get pre-approval for the project.

	•	Additional Resources for Contractors

6. Work with your chosen contractor to get a scope of work and a cost estimate. The Home Energy Rebate should be accounted for in your cost estimate up front as a line-item discount. Ensure that you are comfortable with the final cost of the project, the project timeline, and the work that you have both agreed on. Denver’s rebates require that all work is permitted appropriately, this process should be handled by your installer as well.

7. Look for financing if you need help covering the gap between the rebate(s) and incentives you received and the total cost of the project. The Colorado Clean Energy Fund offers below-market-rate financing for clean energy projects such as installing the equipment covered by Denver's Home Energy Rebates.

	•	Colorado Clean Energy Fund

8. Schedule your installation, and pardon the bustle while work happens in your house. Depending on the scope of work, you can generally expect your new equipment to be installed within a few days.

9. Your contractor is responsible for submitting paperwork to our team about the rebate on your behalf. In the future, someone from Denver’s program may reach out to verify information about your installation or to gather your feedback on the program. Your experience and opinion are valuable to the work we do now and in the future

2022 Program Impacts
“This summer we were able to upgrade our electric breaker box and get a heat pump. We were able to do this because of the generous rebates...We couldn’t have done it without them. This summer we enjoyed a cool home during the hottest days and nights. Now that it has gotten cold, the warm air circulates to keep us all comfortable. Grateful for the comfort of the heat pump and lower environmental impact.” - Jenn, rebate recipient
In 2022, we awarded more than $8.2 million in rebates for electric bikes and home electrification upgrades. $3.9 million of that funding went to income-qualified households, representing about 47% of the total funding.
