Low-To-Moderate Income Household Assistance
The following chart shows income level limits for households to participate in three (3) different programs available locally in the Eagle River Valley, which can help with energy improvements in homes, often resulting in reduced utility costs for the homeowner. Energy Coaches at Walking Mountains can help people apply for and go through any of these low-to-moderate income programs (LMI). Free upgrades may be available with the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and Colorado’s Affordable Residential Energy Program (CARE).
