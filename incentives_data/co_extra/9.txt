Water Heater & Heat Pumps- Energy Efficiency Credits

Electric Thermal Storage (ETS) and Thermal Slab Units
Controlled Off-Peak Heating - $16/kW 
Heated Floors - $12/kW
Product Requirements
Units must be controlled by timers or a master control system 
Minimum qualifying load for ETS is 1 kW



Electric Heat Pump - Air Source
PLEASE NOTE- All air-source heat pump incentives are based on the total "size" of the heat pump system's outdoor unit or (in some cases) units, specifically the outdoor unit coil capacity in tons; while the indoor unit(s) impact the system efficiency ratings, indoor exchange unit capacities are not to be included in the total system size on the rebate application. One ton is defined as 12,000 BTUs for this purpose.
Tier 1- Efficient Air Source Heat Pump
Required HSPF >= 9.0 and SEER >= 15
<= 2 tons = $675 (not to exceed 50% equipment cost)
o > 2 tons = $1800 (not to exceed 50% equipment cost) 

Tier 2 - Cold-Climate Certified Air Source Heat Pump
HSPF >= 10.0 and SEER >= 16; variable speed compressor or a minimum of 3 stages (settings for fan speed)
<= 2 tons = $1000 (not to exceed 50% equipment cost)
>2 tons = $2400 (not to exceed 50% equipment cost) 


Air-to-water heat pump units will be taken on a case-by-case basis. Please include manufacturer, product model number, the rated capacity/size (in tons) and any efficiency specifications available.
Program staff will validate specifications and calculate rebate using the same tier structure as air source heat pumps. 


$100/unit additional incentive for central air source with integrated controlled ETS backup in lieu of a separate ETS incentive
