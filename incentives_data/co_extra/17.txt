system’s outdoor unit or (in some cases) units, specifically the outdoor unit coil capacity in tons; while
the indoor unit(s) impact the system efficiency ratings, indoor exchange unit capacities are not to be
included in the total system size on the rebate application. One ton is defined as 12,000 BTUs for this
purpose.
Incentive
• Tier 1- Efficient Air Source Heat Pump
Required HSPF >= 9.0 and SEER >= 15
<= 2 tons = $675 (not to exceed 50% equipment cost)
> 2 tons = $1800 (not to exceed 50% equipment cost)
