Low-Moderate-Income (LMI) Household Colorado Energy Incentives
Walking Mountains strives to provide inclusive access to energy efficiency to all our community members. By doing so, we offer increased support to income-qualified households. There are three programs that we support in order to accomplish this goal.
> Walking Mountains Internal Low to Moderate Income Assistance Program - 150% Area Median Income (AMI) or less > Colorado’s Affordable Residential Energy (CARE) Program – 80% AMI or less > Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) - Federal low-income assistance

￼
Municipality Specific Colorado Energy Incentives (Vail, Avon, Eagle, and unincorporated Eagle County)
Many towns and municipalities throughout Eagle County are offering increased rebates and incentives including the Town of Vail, Town of Avon, Unincorporated Eagle County and Town of Eagle.
