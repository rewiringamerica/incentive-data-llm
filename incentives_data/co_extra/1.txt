Glenwood Springs Electric customers: take advantage of rebates and free energy coaching

These rebates can significantly cut the cost of such upgrades and purchases as:
	•	Air sealing and insulation
	•	Heating and cooling systems
	•	Programmable thermostats
	•	LED lighting
	•	E-bikes
	•	Commercial energy-saving projects
Plus, Glenwood Electric customers can get free energy coaching through Garfield Clean Energy. GCE’s coaches can help you navigate the rebate options, find out if you qualify for additional financial aid, and connect you with qualified contractors and financing.

Rebate guidelines and forms
This flyer

summarizes Glenwood Electric’s current rebate program. For technical specs on exactly what qualifies for rebates, see the full program guidelines.
Make sure to review the guidelines before spending money on a big project. Some kinds of upgrades, such solar installations, require advance enrollment and a home energy assessment to qualify for the rebate. For other measures you can just purchase the item or have the work done, then apply for the rebate here:
￼
Rebates are also available through MEAN (the Municipal Energy Agency of Nebraska, Glenwood Springs Electric's wholesale power provider) and Black Hills Energy (if you get your natural gas from them). But talk to one of our energy coaches first and they'll help you navigate the various rebate offerings.
Start with a home energy assessment
A home energy assessment (or audit) is a recommended first step before investing in upgrades. It will identify which measures are appropriate for your particular situation – and which will provide the best bang for your buck.
A home energy assessment is a comprehensive evaluation of your home's energy use by a professional home energy analyst. The analyst will perform a blower door test and thermal imaging to reveal where air is leaking in or out of the home, inspect your furnace and water heater, and test your indoor air quality for potential health and safety issues. (See this blog post about the process.) You’ll probably get some free “quick fix” items like LED bulbs, a programmable thermostat or hot water blanket, and afterwards you’ll get a written report listing other recommended measures.
If you meet certain income requirements, you may qualify for a free home energy assessment – visit our ReEnergize page to learn more. 
Glenwood Springs Electric customers who aren’t eligible for a free one can get a home assessment for $200 (the actual cost is $400, but you'll get an automatic $200 rebate from the city). Apply using this Energy Smart Colorado form (Garfield Clean Energy is the Energy Smart Colorado partner for our county). Be prepared to provide your utility company account numbers, home square footage and other details.
