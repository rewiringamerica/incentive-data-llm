2023 RESIDENTIAL & COMMERCIAL REBATES
FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY, SAFETY & ELECTRIFICATION PROJECTS

￼
Solar PV Rebates
For 2023 in unincorporated Eagle County, Walking Mountains will match the Colorado rebate incentive you receive from Holy Cross Energy or Xcel energy.
If you need an electrical upgrade to accommodate a new solar or battery storage system, we will rebate 25% of the cost up to $3,000.
*Stipulations apply and solar and storage rebates are not available for all Eagle County residents.

￼
Low-Moderate-Income (LMI) Household Colorado Energy Incentives
Walking Mountains strives to provide inclusive access to energy efficiency to all our community members. By doing so, we offer increased support to income-qualified households. There are three programs that we support in order to accomplish this goal.
> Walking Mountains Internal Low to Moderate Income Assistance Program - 150% Area Median Income (AMI) or less > Colorado’s Affordable Residential Energy (CARE) Program – 80% AMI or less > Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) - Federal low-income assistance


Rebates are available to homes and buildings in Eagle County in Walking Mountains Science Center territory (excludes the Roaring Fork Valley). Details for qualifying projects start on Page 2.
An energy visit is required prior to a rebate being provided (preferably prior to starting a project).
