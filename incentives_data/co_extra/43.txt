Partner Rebates
In addition to our in-house rebates, residents across Boulder County can also benefit from rebates hosted by external organizations. EnergySmart does not administer the following rebates, and therefore they each have their own requirements, applications, and more. Please read the terms carefully and reach out to the respective administrator with questions!
