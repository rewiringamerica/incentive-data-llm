ENERGY STAR Electric Heat Pump Water Heater
Must be rated minimum of 2.00 Energy Factor. See Energy Advisor for list of qualifying equipment.


Attic Insulation & Air Sealing
R-49 minimum required in open attic; cathedral ceilings will vary with rafter depth. Must perform air sealing in attics prior to adding insulation. For Attic Insulation and Air Sealing: Air sealing requirements include the sealing of the void directly above all accessible exterior top plates in attic space.


Wall Insulation
R-19 minimum; fill wall cavity where R-19 not possible. For solid walls such as brick or concrete, exterior rigid insulation must be added to a level of > R-10


Foundation (Crawl Space or Basement) Insulation & Air Sealing
Crawlspace as outlined in the 2012 IECC. R-15 continuous or R-19 cavity insulation with a vapor-permeable air barrier over insulation. Crawlspaces must have sealed vapor barrier over dirt crawl space floor and ventilation, per 2012 IECC.


Sub-Floor or Frame Floor Insulation & Air Sealing
R-30 minimum, over unconditioned space only (i.e., cantilevers, floors over unconditioned crawl, over garage, etc.). Fill enclosed floor cavities when R-30 is not possible.


Professionally Applied Air Sealing (No Do-It-Yourself!)
Air infiltration levels must be measured by a blower door before & after improvement. Mechanical ventilation recommended if air changes/hour are below 0.35 NACH.


Duct Insulation
R-8 minimum, in unconditioned space only




Solar Rebates Solar PV & Solar Thermal Grant Solar PV & Solar Thermal Tax Rebate

Must be enrolled in EnergySmart, but does not require use of an EnergySmart contractor to be eligible for rebates


Eligibility
Funds generated by the Solar Rebate Ordinance are used to provide grants for the installation of solar systems on individual housing units owned and occupied by low-tomoderate income-qualified residents within Boulder city limits according to the following structure:
� $1 per watt based on system capacity � Limited to 50% of total project costs after other
incentives are applied � $8,000 maximum cap For more information, please visit the city's Solar Grant Information Page: https://bouldercolorado.gov/services/solar-grants The City of Boulder offers a sales and use tax rebate on solar electric or solar thermal (hot water) systems. The city may rebate approximately 15% of the city sales and use tax paid on materials and permits for the solar installation.

Fuel Switching Rebates

Must be enrolled in EnergySmart, but does not require use of an EnergySmart contractor to be eligible for rebates
Boulder has carbon emissions reduction and renewable energy goals, which can be viewed here. Reducing natural gas use in residential homes through electrification of heating systems provides environmental, health, comfort and financial benefits, particularly when done in conjunction with adding solar to a home.
Consider these bundled upgrades to switch fuel sources used by your heating and cooling systems and add solar to receive additional rebates up to $1,500. Can be combined with equipment and insulation upgrade rebates.
Must meet eligibility requirement including use of Xcel Energy approved or EnergySmart contractor to be eligible for equipment and insulation rebates.


Eligibility

Remove a natural gas furnace or boiler, and install air or ground source heat pump
Boiler systems do not require physical removal if there is documentation from installer indicating heat pump installation is appropriately sized to meet the heating needs for the home.
$500 per unit up to $1,000

Modify natural gas furnace with heat pump add-on 
Ducted split system with controls to use the heat pump as the primary and the gas furnace as back-up or secondary heat source.
$500 per unit up to $1,000

Remove natural gas water heater and replace with Electric Water Heater
$500 per unit up to $1,000

Remove natural gas stove/cooktop and replace with Electric Cooktop or Stove. $200 flat rebate.




Solar Solar PV

Installation of solar PV (requires removal of either a natural gas furnace or natural gas water heater)
$500 per installation
