Advanced Heating & Cooling Systems
With more than 55 percent of annual household energy expenses attributed to heating and cooling, energy experts recommend heat pumps because they are the most economical way to keep your home comfortable year-round. Choosing an energy-efficient heat pump is the best purchase you can make for your home. In fact, a heat pump is an ideal heating and cooling option for almost any building.
A heat pump is basically an air system with a reversing valve. These systems use electricity to move the heat found naturally in the air or ground to keep your home or business comfortable year-round. During the cooling season, a heat pump moves warm air out of your home creating a cool indoor environment just like an air conditioner. During the heating season, a heat pump extracts warm air from outside or beneath the ground and moves it into your home.
