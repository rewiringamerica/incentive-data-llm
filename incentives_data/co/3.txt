Colorado Residential Customers

Eligibility Requirements
To be eligible for the rebate, you must:

2. Agree to participate in Black Hills Energy's Time of Day residential electric rate schedule.

3. Agree to install, own, operate, connect to the internet via Wi-Fi, and maintain a new Level 2 (240 volt) electric vehicle charger at your own expense from a qualified manufacturer provider approved by Black Hills Energy. Black Hills Energy requires a qualified electrician install the charging station and it's dedicated circuit. Charger must be installed at a residence that receives electric service from Black Hills Energy.

4. Obtain all necessary permits and comply with all applicable laws, rules, codes, and regulations for the installation of electric vehicle charging equipment. Level 2 (240 volt) charging occurs at a higher voltage rate than Level 1 (120 volt) charging. As a result, an inspection and permit may be required by the city or county where the residence is located.

5. Purchase and install a qualifying Level 2 (240 volt) electric vehicle charger between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023. Rebate application must be received by Black Hills Energy on or before January 31, 2024 to qualify for the rebate.
