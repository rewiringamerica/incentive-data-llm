Colorado’s Affordable Residential Energy Program
Colorado’s Affordable Residential Energy (CARE) program provides income-qualified Coloradans in participating counties with free home energy efficiency upgrades for homeowners and renters.
Energy Outreach Colorado will connect you with a local agency to conduct an energy audit on your home, which will then work with contractors to install qualifying upgrades. These upgrades may include the following: insulation, refrigerators, LEDs, shower heads, air sealing, and qualifying furnaces and water heaters.
