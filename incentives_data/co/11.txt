HVAC Rebates

Furnaces bearing the ENERGY STAR® mark perform up to 15 percent more efficiently than baseline models, which translates into valuable energy savings, cost savings and a reduction in greenhouse gases.

If you are considering installing an air conditioner, or need to replace an old unit, an air source heat pump (ASHP) is a great option. An air source heat pump is an air conditioner with a reversing valve, so it can provide both heating and cooling for your home. Using an ENERGY STAR® ASHP in conjunction with a furnace, can save energy and money because it is approximately four times more efficient than a standard furnace during warmer winter months.

If you are considering utilizing an air source heat pump as the primary heating source in your home, a great option is a cold climate ASHP (ccASHP). It has the same benefits as a standard ASHP, but if it is sized correctly, it does not require back up heat. This is because it can run at a higher efficiency as the temps decrease to below 0°F.

As a natural gas customer, you may earn $250 on a qualifying furnace purchase, or a $500-$1,000 rebate on a qualifying heat pump purchase.

1. When shopping, make sure the model you select meets the following requirements:

ENERGY STAR® for furnaces ($250 rebate)
ENERGY STAR® for ducted ASHP ($500 rebate)
ENERGY STAR® for ductless ASHP  ($500 rebate)
Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) for ccASHP ($1000 rebate)
2. Purchase and install the qualifying appliance using a qualified installer. Be sure to keep receipts.
