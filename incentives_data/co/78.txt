ENERGY-EFFICIENCY
Attention to your attic is often the area of your home where you can get the most bang for your buck on energy efficiency investments.
Step 1: Sealing Attics are often the place where warm air leaks out of the home in winter or into the home during summer. It's best to properly seal trouble spots before adding or improving the insulation. Invest a small amount of money in the necessary supplies, such as caulk, expanding foam or weather stripping, to seal any air leaks in your attic.
Step 2: Ventilation Many attics are under-ventilated, which allows moisture and heat to build up. Moisture causes harmful mold and wood rot. Proper attic ventilation lets air flow from a low point to a high point. This is usually done by installing soffit vents and insulation baffles around the perimeter, plus vents near the peak of the roof. An attic fan can be installed to provide mechanical assistance to exhausting overheated air.
Step 3: Insulation The three main types of insulation for attics are loose-fill, batt and rigid. Whichever type you have, it needs to provide a high-enough level of insulation for your region, measured in R-value. Batt and rigid insulation will often have the R-value printed on them. Loose-fill, which is blown in, is the most common for attic floors, and its R-value is approximately its depth in inches multiplied by 2.8. Your attic should have anywhere from 11 to 24 inches of loose-fill insulation. You can find the recommended level for your region at www.energy.gov. If you have loose-fill insulation that is less than the recommended amount, you should be able to simply add more on top of it, as long as there aren't any moisture, rodent, ant or termite problems.
