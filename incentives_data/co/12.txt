	•	Buildings with 5+ units are not eligible for this program. Denver’s Commercial Building Electrification program is available for all commercial buildings and residential buildings with 5 or more units per building.

	•	Only registered contractors can submit applications to the CARe program on behalf of the Denver resident at the installation address.
	•	The program reserves the right to conduct field inspections to verify information about equipment installation. The program reserves the right to conduct field inspections before rebate payment to verify purchase and, where necessary, installation of eligible equipment.

3. Are rebates instantly applied?
The CARe program is designed to provide Denver residents with instant rebates on eligible equipment and installation costs at the time of project payment. Contractors can register a project bid or “draft’ rebate application on the resident’s behalf before a contract has been signed with the resident to verify funding is available. After a contract has been signed with a resident, contractors can submit a rebate application for a project for review by program staff. Once the project has been approved, rebate funds for the project will be reserved. Contractors will then have a set period of time to complete the project. Once the project has been completed, the contractor will complete and submit the final rebate application and will be reimbursed upon application approval. Additional product specific qualifications and rebate levels are found below.
