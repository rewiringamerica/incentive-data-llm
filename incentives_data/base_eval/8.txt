Incentives
Residential customers can apply to receive rebates up to $1,000 for a solar PV installation. Rebate amounts are calculated based on the schedule of $/Watt of DC system generation capacity shown below and include a 20-year Renewable Energy Credit (REC) assignment to Fort Collins Utilities. See Eligibility Requirements below for more details.

To ensure access to incentive funding to all eligible customers, we manage the solar rebate program incentive cap and earnings rate based on available funding. The table below shows the maximum incentive amount and incentive rate paid per kW of DC generating capacity installed.
