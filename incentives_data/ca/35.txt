Build for efficiency and earn your rewards
Pacific Power offers builders the opportunity to reveive cash incentives for including high-efficiency products and features in new single-family and manufactured homes. Stand out and show your commitment to quality with homes that deliver superior comfort, greater durability and lower energy costs.
Interested builders should contact the program through the Home Energy Savings website.
The builder will be informed of the program specifics and connected with a CABEC Certified Energy Analyst who assists the builder in determining project eligibility, modeling, and testing.
The CABEC Certified Energy Analyst would provide the preliminary modeling results using EnergyPro modeling software to estimate energy savings vs. the 2019 building code standard. EnergyPro gives an estimate of the “percent above California energy code” from which rebate rates and amounts are calculated. Because EnergyPro is used statewide, the software is updated with the changing building codes. EnergyPro shows as optional measured inputs from Duct and building tightness testing. Current California building code (2019) does require duct blaster testing for all homes with ductwork, but does not require a blower door test. So, blower door testing is an additional charge for the builder if they wish to participate in the program. For qualifying homes the incentives are as shown in the Qualification & Incentives section below.
