How the Program Works
There are three stages in the ESA program. Each stage is delivered by an SCE approved contractor. Where possible, contractors will provide remote outreach and assessment services.
Step 1: Qualification and Assessment
To be eligible, you must meet specific household income guidelines. After income qualification, a contractor will do a walk-through of your home to collect information to help SCE determine the potential for installation of one or more appliances or services.
Step 2: Service Delivery
Installation of appliances and services, such as weatherization, are carried out by approved contractors.
Step 3: Inspection
An inspection may be performed in your home to see if the contractor has completed the work to meet our quality standards. If the work is not done properly, it will be redone at no cost to you.

The Energy Savings Assistance Program is funded by California utility ratepayers and administered by Southern California Edison under the auspices of the California Public Utilities Commission. Program and services are available to customers who meet specific household income guidelines or who participate in certain Public Assistance Programs.
Services may not be available in all areas. Certain restrictions, such as the age, size, and condition of the system or appliance to be replaced, may apply. All replacement refrigerators meet ENERGY STAR® standards and are top-freezer models without extra features, such as ice makers. Services are offered on a first-come, first-served basis until funding is expended or the program is discontinued. 
A co-payment may be required for some services. Program may be modified or terminated without prior notice.
California consumers are not obligated to purchase any full-fee service or other services not funded by this program. This program is available to both homeowners and renters who meet the qualifications. Renters may be required to obtain the property owner’s written permission before services are delivered.
