All-Electric Home Program



￼

In Roseville, the benefits really add up with an all-electric home. According to research, California’s buildings represent about 25% of the state’s total greenhouse gas emissions. One way to reduce GHGs is building electrification. This includes switching from fossil fuels to electricity use for space heating, water heating, cooking and clothes drying.   Check out our Residential Electrification Presentation to learn more about the benefits of switching to electric appliances.   We have incentives available for homebuilders who participate in our Electrification pilot program. Eligible homebuilders can receive incentives for all-electric single family and multi-family homes.
