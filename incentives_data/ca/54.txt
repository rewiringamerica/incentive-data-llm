Electric Panel Upgrade Rebate
Receive a $1,000 rebate when you upgrade your existing electric panel to a new electric panel that is 200 amps or higher. Receive an additional $500 if you are enrolled in the utility's income-qualified bill assistance program at the time of application submission.
￼
For most homes, an electric panel upgrade is required to accommodate additional load when making the switch to all-electric appliances/equipment for water heating, space heating, clothes drying, cooking or electric vehicle charging. All-electric appliances and equipment produce less carbon emissions than its fossil fuel counterparts, thereby improving overall indoor and outdoor air quality, as well as the health of our environment.
How To Qualify

	•	A dedicated Level 2 EV charger circuit AND a dedicated electric water heater circuit (240V, 30-amp double-pole circuit breakers), must be included as part of the electric panel upgrade in order to qualify for the rebate.
	◦	Newly installed breakers must be wired in accordance with applicable electric code.
	•	Both standard and smart electric panels are eligible for the rebate.

	◦	Level 2 (240V) chargers must be wall-mounted at the electrical service address provided in the rebate application.
	◦	Chargers (including portable/mobile connectors) that allow the user to switch between Level 1 (120V) and Level 2 (240V) charging do not qualify.
