What makes smart thermostats smart?
They learn! Smart thermostats save energy by automatically adjusting to your schedule and favorite temperatures. Some models can even program themselves.
They also let you control the comfort of your home right from your phone, tablet, laptop and even voice-activated smart home assistants. Returning on a hot day? Cool your home in advance. Away on vacation? Adjust your settings from afar to save energy.
Additionally, smart thermostats provide basic demand response capabilities that allow remote connection with utilities for adjusting thermostat settings during peak demand periods.
