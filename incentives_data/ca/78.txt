Induction cooktop/range
Apply for your $100-$750 induction cooktop/range rebate

Features and benefits

	•	Induction heats up a pot of water nearly twice as fast as gas or standard electric.
	•	More energy-efficient than traditional electric cooktops, which can save you money on your electric bill.
	•	Since its surface is completely sealed, it's safer because there’s no exposed heating element or open flame. And, unless there’s cookware on it, the cooktop doesn’t heat up—even if it’s turned on.
	•	Induction cooktops produce zero kitchen pollution. Natural gas stoves can release carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and other harmful pollutants into the air.
	•	With its smooth surface, cleaning up is a snap.
	•	Precise, digital controls give you the exact heat you want, every time.
	•	Your kitchen stays cooler and less heat is wasted, since the cooktop’s heat is focused on the pan and nowhere else.
￼
Review our Induction Cooktops guide for more information.
Requirements

	•	Must install an induction cooktop/range measuring 24” or larger.
	•	Both standalone cooktops and ranges with built-in induction cooktops are eligible.
Rebates
	•	Electric-to-electric replacements qualify for a $100 rebate.
	•	Gas-to-electric replacements qualify for a $750 rebate. We require a "before" photo of the old gas cooktop/range in place and an "after" photo showing the new induction cooktop/range installed.
	•	For questions about the status of your rebate, please email our Rebate Center or call 916-732-7550.

What is a heat pump water heater?
Heat pump water heaters transfer heat using a refrigeration cycle, like a refrigerator running in reverse, making them extremely efficient.
Features and benefits
More efficient
While gas and electric resistance heaters have a maximum efficiency of 99%, a heat pump water heater can deliver hot water at an efficiency of 300%! Electric resistance water heaters are among the highest energy consuming products in a home. A heat pump water heater can reduce electricity use for water heating by up to 60%. Increased efficiency can also mean lower bills for you.
Safer, cleaner and healthier
Homes and buildings that power appliances with electricity instead of gas are safer—no open flames, no gas leaks, fewer harmful pollutants. Residential natural gas appliances can produce pollutants including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde and ultrafine particles. These pollutants are harmful and significantly contribute to asthma.
Better for the environment
More than 50% of SMUD’s power comes from carbon-free sources and SMUD’s goal is to be completely carbon free by 2030. When you switch from a gas water heater to a heat pump water heater, you’re reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in a cleaner, carbon-free future.
Installation and operational considerations
Your contractor will help you determine if a heat pump water heater is a good fit for your home and whether any electrical work will be necessary. Here are a few things to be aware of when considering a heat pump water heater:
	•	Electrical considerations: Most heat pump water heaters require a 240V circuit and a 30-amp breaker. Contractors from SMUD’s Contractor Network can help you determine if your home meets the electrical requirements or if your electrical system can be modified to accommodate a heat pump water heater.
	•	Size and airflow: Your contractor may recommend a larger capacity water heater to meet your family’s hot water needs. Heat pump water heaters may be taller and wider than your current water heater and they also have specific airflow requirements. If your water heater is located in the garage, you’re probably good to go. If it’s in a utility closet, additional work may be needed to meet size and airflow requirements.
	•	Noise: Heat pump water heaters generate some operational noise, comparable to a loud refrigerator.
	•	Maintenance: In addition to basic water heater maintenance, heat pump water heaters have an air filter that will need to be periodically cleaned.
	•	Exhaust air: A heat pump water heater exhausts cold air after heating your water. This can be a benefit if your water heater is located in your garage or another space that you want to cool in the summer. You can also duct the cool air outdoors or into an adjoining space.
	•	Recirculation pumps: if you have an automated recirculation pump, a heat pump water heater may not be a good fit.
	•	Mixing valve: The program requires the installation of a thermostatic mixing valve to qualify for the rebate.
What mode should be used when the heat pump is installed?
Heat pump water heaters offer several modes of operation, with each manufacturer using their own terminology. The two modes that are most commonly used are “heat pump only” and “hybrid” or “eco” mode.
	•	Heat pump only mode: This is the most efficient way to run your heat pump water heater and the mode that offers the most bill savings, but it does take longer to heat the water.
	•	Hybrid/Eco mode: offers the manufacturer’s best combination of efficiency and performance. The heat pump does the majority of the water heating, with contribution from electric resistance elements only when needed. If your electric resistance elements come on very often, this will increase your electricity bill.
Program requirements
Choose a contractor from the SMUD Contractor Network. These contractors will be familiar with all of SMUD’s program requirements. Here are just a few:
	•	Resident or homeowner must an active SMUD customer with an active SMUD account.
	•	Unit must meet NEEA Tier III or IV requirements for climate zone 12, with a Uniform Energy Factor (UEF) of 2.87 or higher.
	•	Installation must include a thermostatic mixing valve. A mixing valve is a physical component installed on your water heater that blends hot water with cold water to ensure a constant, safe water faucet outlet temperature.
	•	Project must be permitted and meet all city/county ordinances, building codes and permit requirements, including inspections.
	•	Home must be individually metered by SMUD. Multi-unit dwellings (up to 4 units) must be individually metered. 
	•	Additional requirements for manufactured, modular, or factory-built homes:
For the full list of requirements, email Advanced Home Solutions.
