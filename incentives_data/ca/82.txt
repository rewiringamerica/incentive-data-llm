	•	￼ Upgrade Your Home! Check out the rebates available for you to drop your carbon content and save on your bills 
We are helping our customers reduce greenhouse gas emissions (and their energy & water bills) by improving the energy efficiencies of every day equipment within their homes. Additional rebates are available when replacing gas appliances with electric alternatives. In fact, we are now offering rebates for electric panel upgrades to help you prepare for future electrification within your home.
Below you can find each of the rebates available for your home. Click any image to apply online! Alternatively you can click the links on the right to download a rebate application to submit manually. PLEASE NOTE as of 12/31/22 TDPUD is no longer offering rebates for refrigerators, dishwashers, clothes washers or dryers. If you have any questions talk to our customer service representatives at (530) 587-3896

Electric Panel Upgrade
Beneficial electrification is an essential step toward reaching our carbon reduction targets - both locally and nationally. In order to electrify your home you will need to ensure that your service panel is adequately sized to handle the new electric loads. Modern service panels are designed to be 'solar ready' and to handle the demands from carbon friendly electric appliances, EV chargers, and renewable generation!

Energy Star Appliances
Energy Star appliances will save you 10% to 50% in energy use compared to non-Energy Star new appliances, and much more if you are replacing an old appliance! We'd love to help you upgrade to an Energy Star rated induction cooktop or range. We've added home air purifiers to our rebate options too. Save energy and improve your home's air quality at the same time! 
* Note TDPUD no longer offer rebates for refrigerators, dishwashers, clothes washers or dryers.

Heat Pump Hot Water Heaters
Back by popular demand! By extracting free heat from the ambient air, Hot Water Heat Pumps have a low cost of operation compared to gas heaters or electric elements. This means a better result for the environment and your pocket!

Envelope Upgrades
Leaky ducts, drafty doors, and aged windows can all waste energy and can prevent your heating system from maintaining comfortable temperatures inside your home. It's important to regularly inspect and maintain your home's envelope. Regular maintenance can also help maintain indoor air quality!

Heat Pumps for Space Heating & Air Conditioning
Cold-Climate heat pump systems comfortably and efficiently heat your home - even down to sub-zero temperatures. These hyper-efficient and quiet heat pump systems can save you money on heating costs while also adding air conditioning to your home!

EV Charging at Home
Most home chargers can charge any EV using the universal J1772™ connector (Teslas require an additional adapter). Note that Tesla chargers will only work with Tesla vehicles. Whichever charger you choose, it should be tested and certified by a nationally recognized testing laboratory to make sure that it’s safe to use in your home and with your EV. Make sure your charger comes with ENERGY STAR certification to ensure your charger uses minimal energy when not charging.
Some “smart” EV chargers are WiFi enabled and can be managed using an app. Users can set a charging schedule, get convenient reminders to charge, and help you track charging costs and miles driven!

Water Efficient Toilets
Water efficient toilets use 1.28 gallons per flush or less. This is much lower than older toilets which can use 3 gallons of water (or more) with every flush!
