Electric Range and Range/Oven Combo Rebate
Receive a $200 rebate when you purchase a new electric range or range/oven combo. Receive an additional $20 back if you purchase your electric range or range/oven combo in Pasadena.
￼
If you are in the market for a new stove top, consider an electric range due to its lower price and installation costs. Electricity heats more efficiently than natural gas, meaning your kitchen will stay cooler when the range is on. Electric ranges also offer more consistency in temperature and heat distribution, which is better for baking or roasting most types of food. Cleaning an electric range is also incredibly simple, since there’s only one uniform surface to wipe down. More importantly, all-electric appliances like the electric range produces less carbon emissions than its natural gas counterparts since it doesn’t require the combustion of fossil fuels during operation, thereby improving indoor air quality and the health of our environment.
