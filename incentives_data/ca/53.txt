Electric Clothes Dryer Rebate
Receive a $200 rebate when you purchase a new, high-efficiency electric clothes dryer. Receive an additional $20 back if you purchase your electric clothes dryer in Pasadena.
￼
While all dryers have an electric motor that turns the drum of the machine so the clothes tumble and an electric fan to circulate hot air, all-electric dryers use a heating coil instead of a natural gas burner. A few benefits of an all-electric-dryer include a lower purchase cost than a comparable gas dryer and an easier/cheaper installation process (only requires a connection to a 240 volt electrical outlet). More importantly, all-electric appliances like the all-electric clothes dryer produces less carbon emissions than its natural gas counterparts since it doesn’t require the combustion of fossil fuels during operation, thereby improving indoor air quality and the health of our environment.
