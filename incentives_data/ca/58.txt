Residential Electric Vehicle and Charger Incentive Program
Rebates on new EVs end December 31, 2023.
Get up to $1,500 in rebates for new EVs. Vehicle rebates will continue on used vehicles in 2024. You may also qualify for state and federal rebates up to $10,000.
"I had a very positive experience getting my EV rebate from PWP. The people we worked with were tremendously helpful and efficient. Before I knew it, I received my rebate check in the mail. Getting to drive an EV everyday is an added plus!" -- Residential EV Rebate Program Participant, District 3
RESIDENTIAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE INCENTIVES
PWP residential electric customers are eligible for up to a $250 rebate when they purchase or lease a new or used plug-in electric vehicle (EV). Customers are allowed to receive incentives for up to 2 EVs per address every 3 years.
Customers can receive an additional $250 bonus rebate (up to $500) if they purchase or lease an EV from a Pasadena auto dealer. Note: Since Tesla relies on a direct-sale business model where the transaction is completed entirely online, the Pasadena auto dealer bonus will not apply.
An additional $1,000 (up to $1,500) is available for customers currently participating in PWP’s income-qualifying programs.
RESIDENTIAL CHARGER INCENTIVES
Residential electric customers are eligible for a $600 rebate when they install a qualifying “Wi-Fi enabled” or "Internet Connected" EV charger at their home.
