Electric Lawn Mower Rebate Program


The South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD) is pleased to offer a year-round program that allows consumers to purchase new electric lawn mowers.  Please click on the video below for a complete overview of South Coast AQMD's Lawn Mower Rebate Program: 
 Program Details South Coast AQMD has established a residential Electric Lawn Mower Rebate Program to offset the cost of an electric lawn mower.  This program will be available to residents within the South Coast AQMD’s four-county jurisdiction.

Through the Electric Lawn Mower Rebate Program, participants can purchase a new electric lawn mower either online or from a manufacturer-authorized retailer or dealer, including hardware and home improvement stores.  The program will allow residents to turn in their operational, old-gasoline lawn mower to an approved dismantler (PDF, 407KB) for permanent destruction and receive a rebate based on the purchase price of a new battery-operated electric lawn mower. 

The Electric Lawn Mower Rebate Program will be implemented on a first-come, first-served basis and will provide up to $250 towards the cost of the battery electric lawn mower.
Electric Lawn Mower Requirements The electric lawn mower purchased must be new, not used or previously owned, or factory reconditioned.  It has to be zero-emission electric, battery-powered lawn mower.  Corded electric mowers are not eligible.  It must also be a push or self-propelled mower specified for residential use and have a minimum one (1) year manufacturer warranty.  Also, electric lawn mowers purchased as part of a bundled package (with other lawn equipment) are not eligible.  For questions, please email us at lawnmower@aqmd.gov.    NO REFURBISHED OR RECONDITIONED ELECTRIC LAWN MOWERS WILL BE ACCEPTED AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM. Please verify that you are purchasing a new, never used lawn mower BEFORE you scrap your old gas mower.
