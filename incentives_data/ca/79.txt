Smart Electric Panel Rebate

Upgrade to a Smart Electric Panel to receive a rebate of $2,000
Silicon Valley Power customers are now eligible for a rebate of $2,000 when you upgrade your electric panel to a smart panel to accommodate additional load from converting natural gas to electric appliances and/or adding a Level 2 EV charger to your home.
A smart panel allows you to monitor and control individual circuits and may include capabilities to notify you when equipment is running abnormally and needs service. Smart panels can also help avoid electric service upgrades, which is a benefit to you and to the utility, as transformers don’t need to be replaced with larger capacity transformers.
Traditional electric panels are sized assuming that all appliances may be drawing power at the same time. A smart panel monitors electric loads throughout the home and automatically pauses predetermined circuits when total consumption exceeds the home’s electric capacity and allows them to resume when electric usage drops below the maximum capacity.
In addition to the $2,000 rebate, income-qualified customers may be eligible for a bonus rebate of $1,000 for a total of $3,000. Customers who meet the LIHEAP income qualifications may be eligible for a bonus rebate of $1,000, for a total of $4,000.
To be eligible:
	•	The electric panel must be upgraded to a smart panel of 100 amps or greater.
	•	The panel must have an automatic load management system to ensure electricity draw never exceeds the panel rating.
	•	The smart panel equipment manufacturer must provide documentation on and access to a means for local control for use in the event the equipment manufacturer is no longer able to support cloud-based monitoring and control platforms for the smart panel. Local control may be via a REST API, or similar industry-standard interface.
	•	Local control interface shall allow for monitoring power and state control of connected circuits.
	•	Only panel upgrades made on or after July 1, 2022 are eligible for the rebate; projects that received a rebate for a portion of the panel cost through other programs are ineligible.
	•	Panel upgrades must be done for the purpose of home electrification measures.
	•	Properties must demonstrate completed installation of either a Level 2 EV charger or conversion of a natural gas appliance to an eligible efficient electric appliance.
