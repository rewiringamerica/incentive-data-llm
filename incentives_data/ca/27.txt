Safer, cleaner, more efficient
Heat pump water heaters, also known as hybrid water heaters, use 70% less energy than standard electric water heater models by moving heat from one place to another rather than generating it directly. The heat pump water heater takes heat from surrounding air and transfers it to your tank to efficiently heat the water.
We offer heat pump water heater rebates for replacing an existing electric water heater, and for making the switch from gas. You may be able to find additional incentives through The Switch is on.
