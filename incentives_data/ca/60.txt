"I was really impressed with the service and the information I received. We will be getting a free inspection of our A/C ducts, a free inspection of our central A/C unity, a free install of a Nest Thermostat and a free install of a Smart Irrigation Control Unit to replace our old mechanical one. This is really a no brainer for anyone in Pasadena with an older home." -- Home Improvement Program Participant, District 5
Pasadena homeowners are essential participants in securing the future health of our city. As a community and environmental partner, PWP wants to help homeowners and renters save money, use resources more efficiently, and increase the comfort of their homes. That’s why we developed the Home Improvement Program.
