Electric Heat Pump Water Heater Rebate
Receive a $500 rebate when you purchase a new, high-efficiency electric heat pump water heater. Receive an additional $20 back if you purchase your electric heat pump water heater in Pasadena.
￼
Electric heat pump water heaters are more energy efficient because it always takes less energy to move heat than to create it. According to the Dept. Of Energy, “an electric heat pump water heater can have lower energy costs because of its higher efficiency than a gas-fired conventional storage water heater, even though local natural gas costs may be lower than the electric rates”.  More importantly, all-electric appliances like the electric heat pump water heater produces less carbon emissions (and other air pollutants) than its natural gas counterparts since it doesn’t require the combustion of fossil fuels during operation; thereby improving indoor air quality and the health of our environment.
