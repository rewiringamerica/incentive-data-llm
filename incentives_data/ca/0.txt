Appliance Rebates
If it’s time to purchase a new refrigerator, dishwasher, clothes washer, or water heater, Lassen Municipal Utility District (LMUD) offers rebates for the purchase and installation of EnergyStar® appliances and energy-efficient electric water heaters. Depending on the age of your old appliances, you could realize significant savings. Just by replacing your 10-year-old refrigerator with an EnergyStar® compliant model, you could reduce your energy bill by $63 a year! To see exactly how much energy you could save, visit the Energy Star website to use the EnergyStar refrigerator replacement calculator.
