Smart Thermostat Rebate
Receive a $50 rebate when you purchase and install a smart thermostat in your home. Get an extra $10 back when you purchase your thermostat  in Pasadena.

Have you been thinking about getting a smart thermostat for your home? Unlike programmable or manual ones, smart thermostats automatically adjust your home’s heating and cooling. You can “set it and forget it” for greater ease of use, while saving energy. Use our rebate program to get immediate savings when you purchase a qualifying model.

Disclaimer
This program is subject to verification of the purchase and installation of the product(s) before and/or after the rebate has been paid. Completed applications must be received within 180 days from the date of purchase to qualify. Installs must be completed before submitting your rebate application. PWP reserves the right to modify the terms of this program at any time. Rebate amounts will be calculated according to the program incentives at the date of application submission. Program funds are limited and available to eligible PWP customers.
