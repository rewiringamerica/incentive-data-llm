Self-Generation Incentive Program
 
The SGIP is a financial rebate program for customers installing battery storage systems. Currently, the rebate is 15-20% of the average battery cost. The rebate is open to all PG&E customers.
 
In order to be eligible to receive any SGIP storage incentives, residential customers applying for battery storage incentives must transition to qualifying home charging rate schedules:
	•	EV2A
	•	EVB
	•	TOU-C (only for Medical Baseline Customers) 
This is to promote a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by providing the right price signals to charge during “off-peak” times when there are more renewables on the grid. You may also save money on these rates by charging your battery storage system during off-peak times and discharging it during “peak” times.
 
Information to share with your installer
	•	Battery incentives decrease over time. Select the budget category of interest (Small Residential Storage) to track the current incentive.
	•	This budget category is open. This budget category will move into Step 7 soon, updates can be found on the statewide announcements page.
	•	Select the budget category of interest (Small Residential Storage) to track budget allocations.
Apply for the battery storage rebate
 
SGIP may cover the full cost of the battery if you:
	•	Live in Tier 2 or Tier 3 High Fire-Threat Districts (HFTD), or
	•	Have experienced more than two Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS)
	•	And meet one of the following:
	◦	Use life-support equipment
	◦	Meet income eligibility standards
	◦	Rely on an electric well pump for water
	◦	Have incentives reserved in the income-qualified solar programs (SASH or DAC-SASH)
￼ Note: We are currently experiencing high demand for this incentive level under the equity resiliency budget. Have your installer check the status at selfgenca.com program metrics.

Common questions about home battery systems
Will SGIP affect my status as an immigrant?
No, it will not impact your immigration status. The incentives you receive from this program do not count as income. Your eligibility for MediCAL/Medicare benefits will also not be affected.
What are the benefits of pairing my battery with solar?
Pairing your battery with solar can benefit you every day:
	•	If you are on a PG&E Time-of-Use rate or Home Charging rate, you can charge your battery when power is cheaper.
	•	You can also use it in your home when the cost of power is higher. This helps you save the most on your bills under Net Energy Metering.
	•	It reduces your carbon impact, too.
The program also has benefits during an outage:
	•	A battery storage system paired with solar can help power devices for days.
	•	It also lets you recharge your battery during the day to make your backup power last longer.
If I rent my home, can I still install a battery?
If you rent, work with your landlord to determine if you’re able to install a home battery.
Will my home battery work during a power outage?
Yes, batteries can be used as backup power during an outage. If a power outage is expected, you may be able to start charging your battery. Some providers can help you prepare your battery for an outage. This allows your home to stay powered on for as long as possible.
Does my home solar work when paired with a battery during a power outage?
During an outage, your solar system when paired with battery storage will disconnect from the grid and serve as an island providing power from your solar system to only your home.
How long will my battery last?
How long the battery charge lasts is determined by:
	•	Your battery size
	•	Your critical energy needs
	•	The weather (if paired with rooftop solar)
Household usage depends on factors like:
	•	The size of your home
	•	The amount of power your devices need
	•	The weather
When does my battery need to be replaced?
Most battery storage systems use Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries. In most cases, the battery and the components that come with it should last at least 10 years. They should also be warrantied for 10 years.
Does having a home battery mean I am “off the grid”?
No. Having battery storage does not mean you are off the grid. Batteries do not produce power. They need to be charged either by PG&E’s grid or by home solar systems.
Who handles what?
PG&E and the battery provider will both play a role in the process.
Your household
	•	Choose a battery storage provider from our approved SGIP developer list (XLSX).
	•	Determine if you are eligible for SGIP. Your battery storage provider can help you learn more.
The battery storage provider
	•	Submits an application.
	•	Helps you choose the right system for your home.
	•	Programs the battery to best fit your needs.
	•	Describes how the battery works and answers your questions.
	•	Installs your system.
	•	Deals with any battery issues after it is installed.
PG&E
	•	Reviews the application.
	•	Completes any system upgrades.
	•	Gives approval when it is safe to connect your system to the grid.
	•	Provides SGIP funds to either you or your battery storage provider.
What is the maintenance process?
Repairs are often included in the contract. Discuss this with your storage provider before you sign.
Your system may come with remote monitoring software. This means if your system fails, the battery company will be notified. The company can then send technicians out to address the problem.
Can home batteries be installed indoors and outdoors?
Most suppliers can offer you both indoor and outdoor options. If you get an outdoor system, make sure the enclosure is Underwriters Laboratories (UL)-certified or National Electrical Manufacturers Association-rated.
Are home battery systems safe?
Most suppliers can offer you both indoor and outdoor options. If you get an outdoor system, make sure the enclosure is Underwriters Laboratories (UL)-certified or National Electrical Manufacturers Association-rated.
How big is the battery?
The size of your home battery mostly depends on your energy needs. Most battery storage providers offer a range of sizes. For a typical home, a garage will provide enough space to install the battery. Your storage provider can help you select the right place for your unit.
Do home batteries make noise?
Battery systems create a small amount of noise. The volume of noise is usually less than or equal to the sound of an air conditioner.
Battery storage
Battery storage systems are often connected to the grid and your electric system.
 
The system performs two main functions:
 
	1	Charging. Store power generated by your solar system and from the grid when power is cheaper. This stored power can be used later.
	2	Discharging. Stored power can be used during an outage or at night. Save money by using it when the price of power from the grid is higher.
 
Benefits of battery storage
	•	Helps temporarily extend power to a home or business (an average of 4-6 hours) during an outage 
	•	Keep important devices running during an outage
	•	Stores excess solar energy generated during the day for use at night
	•	Sustain a multi-day outage
	◦	How long your system will provide backup power depends on your battery size, critical energy needs, and if paired with rooftop solar, weather conditions. Talk to a battery storage provider to learn more about your specific needs and options.
	•	Cost and electricity savings:
	◦	Whether you're on the Home Charging EV2A* rate or a Time-of-Use rate*, you can charge your battery when power is cheaper. You can also use it in your home when the cost of power is higher.
*Customers must be on either of these two rate plans.
