Solar Attic Fan Rebate
Receive a $80 rebate when you purchase and install a solar attic fan. Get an extra $20 back when you buy in Pasadena.
￼
Looking for an environmentally friendly way to keep your attic cool in the summer, and dry and ventilated during the winter? Solar attic fans -- small, rooftop ventilation devices powered by the sun -- are a popular choice for many homeowners. Purchase and install a new unit and get up to $100 back through PWP’s rebate program. See terms below.
How to Qualify

	•	Purchase your unit in Pasadena for an additional $20 rebate.
	•	Submit your online rebate application after installs are completed, along with a copy of your detailed receipt/invoice and the required supporting documents, within 180 days from date of purchase.
How to Apply
	•	Log in to your PWP account.
	•	Select “Apply for Rebate”
	•	Please note you will need to upload your complete sales receipt or paid invoice, including:
	◦	Product and model number and CFM Rating
	◦	Date purchased and installed
	•	Once approved, your rebate check will arrive in 6 to 8 weeks.
Terms
	•	Only residential PWP electric utility customers are eligible.
	•	Limit to 2 fans per customer, every 7 years.
	•	Are you enrolled in PWP's income-qualified Bill Payment Assistance program? If so, you will receive an $80 bonus per unit. Visit the Under One Roof Program webpage to learn more.
Disclaimer
This program is subject to verification of the purchase and installation of the product(s) before and/or after the rebate has been paid. Completed applications must be received within 180 days from the date of purchase to qualify. Installs must be completed before submitting your rebate application. PWP reserves the right to modify the terms of this program at any time. Rebate amounts will be calculated according to the program incentives at the date of application submission. Program funds are limited and available to eligible PWP customers. Rebates apply to new appliance and product purchases only (refurbished/reconditioned do not qualify). Customers must be enrolled in one of PWP's income-qualified bill payment assistance programs at the time of application submission in order to qualify for the bonus.
